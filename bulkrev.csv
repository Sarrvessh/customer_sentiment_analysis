review
"I had this case for a week and it left marks on my ipod. Never get a cheap silicone case. It doesn't keep dust out, it leaves marks and its not worth it if you want to keep marks and scratches off of your ipod don't get it. Get a hard cover case instead they actually protect your ipod."
iphone case broke at the tabs within 1 month of usage while opening it to clean.  FM transmitter does not work well. Too much static and transmits only 4 frequencies. It is useless.  Audio quality of ear phone mic is too low and bad. Can't use it either.  It is not worth its price.
"Sound quality is not great. Mounting screws into plastic will not hold up. Very disappointed with my purchase.  For 400 bucks I expected better. Also cannot see radio when mounted, unless you bend way forward and look up. Poor product."
The ear buds don't work right ! Not clear enought
"The sleeve is nice, it is very soft on the inside and I never worried about the kindle being damaged while it was inside the sleeve. The problem that I had with this product is that when your Kindle is not in the sleeve, there is nothing to protect it. In fact, I dropped my kindle when it was not in the sleeve and caused damage to it.     I guess it depends on how mobile your Kindle will be. If you plan on taking it with you on a plane/train/bus, this is not the best protection against bumps and dings. On the other hand if you plan on keeping your Kindle at home the sleeve is great."
"I got the item pretty quickly after ordering and I really like the price, but the plug sticks when removing from my iPhone 4S."
plays okay except when you try to plug into radio it not loud enough.. as soon as you  it in it goes low..good with head phones that's it though.. not what I expected..
"This boombox played quite well for a few months and then malfunctioned.  The CD's began not loading correctly and would go on and off not play certain tracks, though the radio played fine.  Then the AC jack on the unit must have become loose, because the system kept going off power and I'd have to keep fussing with and pushing the cord into AC jack.  It would play but then the power would go off again.  This boombox was very shortlived in its right functioning."
"I ordered this product once before at Christmas and had no problem.  It was shipped in an oversized box and arrived in perfect condition.  My son dropped his DS and it was a good thing he had the protective cover on it.  It broke the protective cover, so I decided to order another.  Well, this time, it arrived cracked through the USPS so I contacted them and asked them to ship another---same thing--arrived cracked.  I called them and told them to put it in a box.  They put it in a box that snugly fit the cover and same thing--cracked.  I did eventually get a credit, but would've loved to have been able to receive the case in working order.  If I were to order the product again, I would insist on the oversized box as packaging.    I would love to spend more on the aluminum play through cover, but so far it is only made for DSI.      I will wait!"
Originally item was shipped wrong from china.  They did correct it and sent what was advertised.  After one week of use the cord is already coming apart and now it is just a matter of time before the wire breaks and I have to throw it away
"It arrived broken, good concept for a night light, but it was in little pieces...."
"I  had the classic first  which was awesome. great product, great price, durable  metal shell, compact Small size, sounded great hooked up to Bluetooth  with little easy l ease.  perfect.  I  then upgraded because two has gotta be better than one right.  WRONG.  oversized, bulky, cheap plastic exterior, nearly impossible to get them to pair to each  other  and then when you do  you gotta pair too them.  I was shocked how cheaply made they are for the price, overpriced.oh  the sound is  terrible.  make a constant clicking noise, they get loud just terrible quality."
"This box looks cool and has a neat finish, but I took mine back where I bought it after the buttons stopped working.  Stop worked once in a while, fast forward worked sometimes:  Memorex needs to stick to blank media.  Cool looking isn't good working."
I wanted something taller.  Not tall enough to fit my Apple 6 plus phone in my Logictech docking station !  Opening is to narrow.<br />Does not work!  For me.
Will not keep book chapters in order.
"I would not recommend this product. The velcro is cheap and falls off easily. After only two workouts with it I had to go to a convenience store and buy velcro to use it. I'd just go with a more expensive version of this, it's worth the money."
This case does not stay on at all.  it is flimsy rubber to begin with and does not sit well on the sides of the device.  The only thing that keeps this on the ipod is the bottom portion that covers the button.
The item worked for less than 3 months. I didn't like that it powered itself off everytime I turned the off the ignition of my vehicle. The item does have a 1 year warranty but you have to pay shipping to the manufacturer and $15 for the item to be returned to you. I paid less than $15 for the item. Very disappointed in the quality of this FM transmitter.
"Here's an interesting toy that fits the bill to be described as \\""it is what it is\\"". It works for the most part as advertised, but probably isn't the ideal I thought it would be. I bought it because Hurricane Sandy had me thinking about how I'd entertain myself should the grid go down. I probably should have saved my money and bought one a little more high-end.<br /><br />When you get it, it's put in a green-friendly box. The one-sheet manual tells you to keep the packaging - the inside of the box has a silvered piece of paper that some videos I've seen on YouTube were using as a screen, and another piece of cardboard that is meant to be used as a stand for the projector. Not the most ideal situation there - I'm expected to carry around cardboard in order to use this effectively? I'd rather just project the image on a light-colored wall.<br /><br />I suppose it's well-built for its size - it's got a aluminum casing protecting the LED and lens.  Lens is focused with a small dial on the top of the unit. Its dimensions are 3\\""x1 1/2\\""x7/8\\"".<br /><br />There is no internal speaker - it uses earbuds for audio, which are included. There are some minimal audio controls inside a menu, which, when I played with them, didn't appreciably change the audio coming through the earbuds.  Maybe one of those little powered MP3 speakers would work better? Well, you could hear the audio from MP4 videos played through it anyway.<br /><br />It's powered by a sealed-up rechargeable battery. No provision for external power at all. The picture projected is typical of a tiny projector - brighter the closer you get to the wall (Pretec recommends 9 inches, but in a completely dark room it could probably go a lot bigger. In a not-so-dark room, I could get a decent picture about twice that size.). Also, the MicroSD card that was supposed to be included - wasn't.<br /><br />Testing it with a couple of MP4 videos was a mixed bag. My job is editing video, so I know a little something about making MP4s.  I tried a downloaded video from YouTube, an MP4 of a Hollywood movie I had lying around, and an MP4 I made for a client.  Both the YouTube and Hollywood MP4s played, but with monster digital artifacts. My best guess of why that is is that the MP120 has a 320x240 maximum resolution, and the thing is resizing the videos on the fly.That happened on both the 320x240 YouTube and the 720x480 Hollywood vid.  Pretec does have a downloadable piece of software that's supposed to convert vids to MP4 that I haven't used yet. Maybe that will improve the video (though typically you don't want to recompress an already compressed video)?  The MP4 I made from the client's file one way didn't play at all: make an MP4 from the same file with a different MP4 maker and it played fine. What does that mean? You have to decide."
It has stopped working after only a few days use. It will not charge. I am disappointed because I enjoyed being able to talk hands free and hoped that I would have had more than a few days of use. There is nothing wrong with the charger outlets in my car. I tested it with another device.
"The appearance is really cool. Looks just like a mini ipod. But dont be fooled. The buttons arent like those of an ipod. You have to press it -___- The menu is extremely ugly. Everything is pretty much ugly except for its appearance. Sound quality is good but i like my music extremely loud. In conclusion, I would have to say that this player fits best for a 10 year old :P"
"I bought this at Costco; and it does not keep good time.  I contacted IHOME customer support multiple times and they had me unplug it and take out the batteries and other things but it still lost time; about a minute every 2-3 weeks.  After six months, I have taken it back to Costco.  I found IHOME's customer support to be less than friendly; these folks do not smile on the phone.  I never did get the IHOME app on my Iphone to work with the unit either; even with customer support help numerous times. Twice the alarm did not even work and thank goodness I woke up naturally or I would have been late to work.<br /><br />I never used the remote control or the am/fm radio anyway.  I did like the big bright numbers on the clock tho."
I am having the same problem with this battery that many others have reported. It does not fit properly and falls out of the unit. I will have to find some way to make it stay in. At least there is a replacement battery.<br /><br />Update: I compared this battery with my old ones and it is just a little too small in height. I cut a piece of plastic from the packaging of the battery to act to tighten up the battery. I cut it to almost the exact size of the bottom of the battery and placed it on the bottom including the slot. It seems OK now but I do not know how long this will last. I would not use tape (as others have suggested) as the glue will become a mess.
This is a great product for the iPhone however I needed it for a iPod touch. I was told it would work for the iPod but it wasn't any good even though they sent me an additional one...it still wouldn't work.  The product is great for having an iPhone<br />But not the  iPod touch. The company is great if they have a something else I need i will support this company!
"Did not work in my old IHome alarm clock due to the angle of the phone when connected, no support.  It did work in my old portable Bose system.  It's priced right but offers NO support!"
but mine was poorly cut. It would also be better if it were a hard case. Silicone still makes it feel kinda vulnerable.
"The machine does it`s job but I never use it. You can`t clean really large area with it, and for the small spillages and stains  it is much easier just to sprinkle over some good chemical and wipe out with a cloth. Just think - you unwind the cord, fill the tank, clean, suck, clean the tank, curse  the stupid lock between the tank and the trunk, wind the cord... Oh, no, man!  <br />I think that I just waisted my money."
"I used this product on the beatbox with iphone 5. Sound was noisy and scratchy when I connected through A2DP. Gave this a try, and had a bad experience, so returned it."
It has become outdated with the advent of wireless compact speakers. Good concept and would be better if it were wireless.
To much feedback  The person I am talking with hear them self as an eheco in the back ground
I Am Still Trying to Figure Out How It Works.  No Instructions Came With It.  The Options I Have Tried Are Fruitless.
"I use it when I do intense exercise.  I get sweaty.  This armband does nothing to protect my iPod from getting covered in sweat and in turn, getting caked with dried sweat.  This is not good for my iPod in the long term.    I will say though that I've owned it for a few months and it hasn't malfunctioned apart from its design flaw.  But this problem is enough for me to recommend staying away."
"We bought 1 of these for me and another for our daughter. Hers arrived needing the battery charged.  It was unable to charge at all. She ended up returning it.  Mine charges ok, but usually takes forever to locate satellites."
"This OEM-like head unit looks very nice and seems to be decent quality on the outside. The image quality is good and there are many connection ports on the back making it for a very versatile radio. The navigation and DVD works well and the SD card function is decent. This makes for a decent amp and I can notice better sound quality in my speakers. I have not hooked up to a subwoofer, but it appears you can do this as well.<br /><br />That is more or less where it stops. The radio sound is poor quality and the aux volume cannot be controlled from the head unit. Even after turning up my mp3 player to full volume I can still barely hear my music via aux. The clock keeps going back two hours after multiple resets. The SD card audio is great, but there is absolutely no sorting. I currently added 1000 songs to an SD card and sorted by artist, genre, etc. The SD music files on the radio interface merely show up as one large list. I'm not even sure how it is sorted, so it makes it virtually impossible to find music. The bluetooth function for phone calls works great on my end, but I have been told the quality on the receiving end is mediocre to poor. Lastly, I got a different unit than what is pictured here... the unit I received does not even have a brand name and is slightly different. It almost seems to be a better unit in some respects, but considering the poor quality that I received I am not sure.<br /><br />All in all, if you don't mind the above this is a great radio and looks great. The functions that work are great, but the functions that don't make it a non-sale for me. I am currently working with the seller to return. Hopefully, this will not be an issue. So far they seem to be very helpful and even changed my shipping to ship Fedex so it would ship to the correct place. I'm assuming they will not give me any trouble.<br /><br />Will post back if anything else comes up."
"I can't believe this won't charge my iPad. I'm not sure who to be madder at apple or OEM. Soooooo annoying. It does work with my iPhone, but really....I can't believe that I have to have 2 different chargers."
"With in  two days of purchasing this item, the rubber pulled away from the cable and metal fell off! Very disappointed!!"
"This case does not fit well, the front and back cover do not snap together tight.  I dropped my phone and the case popped off before my phone hit the floor."
"Good instructions, the waterproof test worked, but none of the buttons work. If you can get the volume button to work in any direction, it holds the button on the Ipod all the way down in that position. You have to open the case up and put the volume back where you want it. The power button does not work at all."
I bought the product and it worked great for the first month and a half now it stopped working. I have to put the speaker to my ear to hear it and it just stopped working while it was connected to my computer left alone.
This bulb has a very annoying &#34;feature&#34; in that when switched on via light switch it defaults to FM radio at the first setting. So on turning on you get full blast static. Also not the sellers fault but I assumed that like all other led light speakers this had Bluetooth which it does not. Though this would work nicely in the bathroom but where it defaults to full blast static I cannot find I place in my house I can use this.
"I purchased this watch to monitor my heart rate during aerobic exercise and to track mileage/speed/cadence (with bike mount) while riding my bicycle.  for the first 18 months the watch and accessories worked great, only had to change the batteries is the watch once.  about 3 months ago i noticed the rubber watch band had some cracking in it.  Now half of my watch band has broken apart and i can no longer wear it.    I contacted Garmin to see about a warranty repair...they said after one year, no go, it'll be $89.00 to repair.  That's what i paid for the watch!!  I will not be purchasing anymore Garmin watches."
The day i looked for a new protetive case....... i typed in Ipod 4th blah blah blah protective and a cople dayz after i got it i dropped it..........and i cracked<br />luckly it still worked if not........ you woulnd not be reading this right now
You can't turn the volume up on your headset without distortion.  It's ok in a pinch but it's not a replacement for a wireless headset
"I would not recommend buying these flat irons😔, I bought them to use for my daughters hair, she has thick curly hair, and they didn't work, the ceramic plates dont close together tightly, very disappointed. I gave it two stars because it arrived before time😏"
"I see why this product only sells for 1 cent on here. Its very cheaply made. I don't know how long it will actually work for, but I'm hoping it will last for awhile atleast. In my opinion, I would try to find the Apple made product on here instead of this."
"Function is very good<br />But questions about the price, high price<br />The poor quality of the sound quality<br />Choose carefully!!"
"My husband and I have a trip to the Canadian Rockies planned for September. We decided it made sense to buy a GPS since it would make the trip a lot easier if we can just pop in the addresses rather than printing out all the directions before we go. Plus, we figured we could use any time we are going someplace we are unfamiliar with. Well, we've been using it for just over a month and it's much more trouble than it's worth. I'm so used to any technology we buy having a nice \\""plug and play\\"" ability and this absolutely doesn't have that.    Garmin's website is not very helpful and the unit comes with almost no instruction/literature at all. We finally got the traffic to show up on our unit, but it only works sporadically. I live in a big city and on numerous occasions it will show that there is no traffic when I check and in fact, I'm sitting still in bumper to bumper traffic. I have also already driven two places that it didn't recognize the address for. Isn't the point of a GPS to get you places that are unfamiliar? We ended up asking for directions on one occasion and on the other occasion we happened to have other people in the care with Google Maps on their iphones and Google Maps got us there.    Overall, we are very disappointed. I wouldn't buy again."
"First off, you should know that for some people this will be a very good subwoofer.  If your only concern is with SPL, i.e. having a sub that causes hearing loss, head-aches and makes your neighbors yearn for your death, then this is a fantastic choice.  However, if you are actually concerned with the musical quality of your bass then you need to look elsewhere.  This sub doesn't play deep, it doesn't play clean, it simply eminates a tremendous quantity of bass that isn't worth hearing.  The bass reproduced by this sub sounds simply like power converted into sound and not an actual element of music.  I'm sure people who own this sub are very proud of how much it makes the rear-view mirror rattle, as well as the amount of attention they are able to garner as they cruise past wal-mart with the windows down; but I fail to believe anyone really truly enjoys the sound that is created by this discus of decibals.  In short, if you want loud (and all you want is loud), consider getting this sub. If you want a sub that actually sounds good, try kicker/rockford/soundstream/audiobahn/boston or some other brand that realizes bass isn't simply a frequency that makes your trunk sound like the apocolypse is beginning, it's an actual element of music."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter. It works with her ipod nano 4th gen.  It is not an easy item to figure out. To set the alarm you have to pick up the clock and use the button  inconveniently located on the back.   Also, whenever the ipod is docked and you use the click wheel to advance to a different song the clock returns to flashing 12:00. You have to remove the ipod from the clock to avoid resetting the time.   The sound is OK, not great but OK.   If I only paid $10.00 I would expect the poor quality and quirks....but at $50.00 it is a HUGE disappointment."
"I had the Galaxy Note 10.1 for about a week before I received this screen protector, so I had some experience with it 'as is'. After applying this protector, the experience changed significantly for two main reasons:<br />1) As stated in other reviews, the original screen offers a somewhat 'slippery' writing experience, which is not what we are used to when writing in actual paper. This screen protector provides a slightly rougher surface, making the writing experience closer to the 'real world' paper experience. This is not necessarily a change for better: I didn't like it, mostly because there is some sensitivity lost (discontinuous traces).<br />2) The screen loses quality, going from a beautiful high-def to a grainy image especially on bright colors (noticeable when the tablet is less than a meter away, which is most of the time in normal use). I found this to be unacceptable, and the main reason why I am giving it 2 stars.<br /><br />PROS<br />- protects the screen<br />- cheap (3 pack)<br />- relatively easy to apply<br /><br />CONS<br />- Rougher screen, loses sensitivity with the S-pen.<br />- Degraded screen quality."
"I just got it today. It's a very basic mp3 player, which is all I'm looking for. The headphones that came with it suck, but I tried my own headphones and the mp3 player itself works great. The thing is ADORABLE. Cute and small, and the encasing is made out of something that reminds me of the EOS lip balm containers :D.     I know this isn't quite a trustworthy review since I just got it recently, but if malfunctions, I'll update my review.    **UPDATE: Well, I rated it five stars at first when I bought it two months ago, but sadly my little player isn't functioning all that well anymore. It still plays, but I've been starting to have trouble uploading songs...and the battery life unfortunately isn't that long :(. Oh well, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for!"
Well it was working ok but it always goes.into safe mode and gets hot to fast but after all its a good amp
My daughter asked me to purchase this for her new ipad mini and I did thinking it had a front cover.  The description says it protects all edges and front and back.  Be aware that this is a back cover only and in no way provides any protection to the glass front.  We are shopping for another case as I type this.  Good quality otherwise...
"poor performance, bad swr 2.0:1 on all bands, compared against cheap dual band antenna and the cheeper antenna had better performance. very heavy and need to be mounted to a solid fixture, magnets are too week"
"This is a nice looking little unit - but it does not work with Mac. I assumed it would since it has Bluetooth and I have successfully connected other devices via Bluetooth - but not this one. I read the manual, and downloaded the Mac bluetooth driver from their website, but no luck. It shows up as a modem and won't allow me to connect. Nor will it connect with a USB cable. So if you have a Mac, look elsewhere."
It fell apart after I used it for a week.
"Although this is advertised as a 3790T case, it is in fact wider than the device by about an inch, longer by about a half inch. In my view its simply the wrong size."
I returned it for a refund.  Stopped functioning after a few weeks.
"Just got it out of the box, hooked up to pc to verify current  map and current software.  Ok.. Now put it in the car. let it charge up a little bit.Driving with it active to my kids school, 1/2 mile into my ride  it just shut itself off & refused to power backup. Unplugged from poweroutlet, still nothing.. GGrrrr..  pressed the power on switch countless times.. nothing! GGrrr..  then it just decided to reboot itself.. worked about another 1/2 mile, dead again with about 1o seconds being dead,rebooted  and asked if I wanted to continue my route.....    back in the box in hopes of getting one that actually works without killing itself.. one more chance thats it!  Costco has an excellent return policy.. no bs..just $ back if you dont want it.."
Very clear signal but you cannot charge and play at the same time unless you like a nice squealing sound. i should have heeded the other reviews but i didn't
This is a beautiful and very functional case with a major problem.  The magnets that keep the cover closed made our iPods freeze repeatedly. I bought 2 of these for both my husband and myself and each of us experienced problems.  I finally removed the magnets and placed small velcro tabs on the corners to close it.  Will see if this works OK.
"I ordered the clear protector, which doesn't seem to cause any distortion.  I assumed the glass needed protection.  However, the tolerance at the edge is so tight that I can't seem to get it on without having part of it overlap, making a good fit impossible.  Definitely not worth the effort/money I put into it, since other people who seem to know about these products keep saying that \\""gorilla glass\\"" doesn't need protection.  After I've gotten over my irritation at wasting an hour last night trying to put on the first cover, I'll probably watch their video and try to put on the second cover."
I tried connecting it to an iPhone 5 pin with a 30 pin converter to try to get better quality but it does not work.
"I think the product description if for a different product. The main reason being this was described to be 12v and plug in to a cigarette lighter. Well it runs off an onboard 3v watch battery. Ofcourse it did not come with instructions, it will not power on and since the product description is wrong - I would not know what to expect if it would power on because I do not know what this item does. AArrgghh!!"
It worked fine for about 3 weeks and then died! I am not going through the hassle of returning it. I used it with the iPhone 5s.
"Just like the other case I got, when I put it on my iPod, the fin ripped.<br />I also did not get the lanyard.<br />I would not recommend this product, aswell."
"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with this product. The highs were tinny, the base response was lousy and interfered with the kiss, even at low volumes. Goes to the old adage, you get what you pay for...."
"This sounds like a great offer. I purchased 3 of these, one for my boyfriend's birthday, one for me when I heard how great his sounded and one for when I had to send my boyfriends back due to problems with the sound and the radio kept disappearing and use the warranty to get another one. Within a month there were problems with both players. Mine would only play thru one earpiece and then none unless you held the connection piece in the whole time listening, and my boyfriends's started having a tinnie/tinny sound to the music and the radio selection would disappear with the first, the second one did the same as the first and then his earpiece gave out too. Now this was something that is internal so purchasing another set of headphones would not help. Also the manual is hard to understand and no company information was provided. Basically I am out of $$ since we both ended up getting better player for Xmas. Thank Goodness. Also the only game on it was soduku and it hardly ever worked."
Found it extremely difficult to download on it
"First of all, it looks NOTHING like the picture! Right away the plastic started to break and pieces have actually chipped off. It doesn't properly fit the iPod also. I would not recommend it to anyone. Sorely disappointing."
"This looks great, but the durability is bad. The holder got broke, when it was holding my GPS while travelling."
"Other than the fact it took a month to receive, they were exactly what I ordered.  They also, came with do wiring specs on the pins and the pins are too small for a connector. You have to solder"
"Yes, this extends the dock connection and allows function of speaker accessories, but it does not accommodate charging your iPhone 4.  For that reason, I was happy that I also ordered \\""CableJive dockStubz Charge Converter and 30-pin Pass Through Adapter for iPhone, iPod, and iPad\\""  (I ordered the stub, not the cable).<br />Some sort of change happened from my original iPhone to the iPhone 4 which made many of my older accessory products (speakers, chargers, etc) useless.  The CableJive is truly an adapter that allows charging-- the Patazon Black Extenion Dock Extender does nothing more (for me, at least) than make an extended connection but does not allow charging.  Yes, the cost of the CableJive is substantially more, but at least it brings full function to all of my accessories without having the cost of replacing them."
"I got this for my touch screen Nook, when it arrived it was bigger then my nook.  It appears to be a case for the nook color not the touch.  I am able to use it for now but I am looking for a better fitting one."
The batteries I received did not work. They just make my Garmin keep rebooting.
"...it's too big for my Garmin Nuvi 255w.  It's a nice case and seems sturdy enough for the price, but the gps unit does not fit snugly.  The case is too big and the gps slides around inside.  It should not be advertised as a case to fit this unit."
"The docking station as a whole is ok, but the quality of the radio is &#34;lacking greatly.&#34; There is static even with the antena in use!!!"
The push buttons don't always work and have to be pushed several times before they work.<br /><br />The memory function doesn't work. Music from a cd can't  be stored on a &#34;SD &#34; card.<br /><br />The batteries have to be replaced much too frequently.<br /><br />If I had bought this at a local store I would have returned  it by now.
"Seems like every time I pull it out to use it the battery is dead. I charge it before storing it.<br />Also, the Bluetooth connection is very finicky.... When it has a connection it's great....but at times it will just drop the signal."
Hard ti fit
"Updated to include details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.<br /><br />I did research between the Kindle and Sony Touch for awhile, and bought the Touch.  I hadn't really been figuring in the Nook during that time, because I thought it was still $259 and that books were more expensive on the barnes and noble site. But the moment I caught wind of the nook price change.....<br /><br />I quickly packed up the Sony Touch and returned it. Things I didn't like about it:<br />- When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, sluggish bare bones E-reader.<br />- The SONY online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.<br />- I sort of saw my reflection when trying to read on the Sony. Granted, it's no mirror and I might have gotten over it, but with that Nook dangling in the back of my head, I had to switch.<br /><br />For 20 dollar less, I think the Nook is more attractive, better book selection, and has wifi. You don't have to tool around with books on your computer to then put them on your e-reader, which is a pain in the butt.<br /><br />Below is my more indepth comparison of the 3 readers(Sony, Kindle and Nook)if you're interested!<br /> - Nook(N) by barnes & noble<br />- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com<br />- Sony Reader Touch(ST)<br /><br />1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.<br /><br />N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.<br />K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?<br />ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.<br /><br />2. PRICE!<br /><br />N: $149 with wifi<br />ST: 169 NO WIFI<br />K: $139 with wifi(or $189 with wifi and free 3G)<br /><br /> While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.<br /><br />*You can now lend book from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new \\""lend me\\"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two readers you cannot lend at all.<br /><br />*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of $50+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.<br /><br />*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!<br /><br />*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen, it was slow to respond and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.<br /><br />*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.<br /><br />*Yet, the Nook is heavier by 3oz then the Kindle or Sony.<br /><br />*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.<br /><br />*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.<br /><br />On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I even bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. I like using the touch screen to \\""swipe\\"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. one fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.rnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon.

"The head unit fit well in the car and the steering wheel integration worked flawlessly. The MFD (dash board display) integration of the radio was OK but that was it. Incoming phone calls was presented as \\""error\\"" and \\""iPod\\"" was shown when an iPhone was connected.<br /><br />The head unit worked well for almost a month and then things started failing. iPhone charging went first, closely followed by iPhone controls. After that Bluetooth died and now it locks up on start up. The only way to get it started at all is to pop out the map card and reset it. This sometimes brings it partially back.<br /><br />Have been in contact with the support people and they initially responded but haven't replied at all lately.<br /><br />If you buy this unit then make sure you keep the box for a month in case you have to send it back."
"We received this system as we were replacing an older model of another style of communicators.  After two days the power supply cord quit functioning and I have been attempting to find one locally to avoid the hassle of shipping and return authorizations. I cannot find one, but now the entire system is becoming difficult to call functional at the least.  The transmitting keys will stay engaged, preventing everyone else on the system from being able to communicate.  The supposed 25 mile range barely functions within the same building.<br /><br />I will be returning this system at my first opportunity."
Don`t charge from ipod dock.I took a chance so you don`t have to.Save your money. Also the conectors are cheap.
"One of the mayor problems is transmitting via radio frequency which are too jammed over the cities. Even on the highway it's hard to find the appropriate frequency. Anyway once you find it and get hoocked, the sound quality is not good.  I've had the same experience with other models of transmitters, I thought this was gonna be different as I read the reviews seems to be OK to give a chance.  I wish I had installed a wired Aux-in directly to the stereo rather than this solution.  this 8 in 1 transmitter is good looking, charges the iPhone, hands free (if you have good reception, which is not always).  I recommend not to buy this kind of transmitter at all. If you are, try something that you are sure is gonna meet your expectative by seeing it working before you buy it. (ask a friend who already owns something that actually work)"
"I bought this gps holder in 2010 and it looks nothing like the picture that is there now (2013), so maybe they have updated the model.  The one we have used to hold in place on the dashboard, but now the friction is much less stong and it slides around quite a bit when braking. Also, there are a lot of adjustable parts that have not held up well."
"was difficult and complicated to synchronize or configure with steering wheel controls, so that I could install in my car, need more information and assistance in completing the installation"
"I bought this as a plug to go from my phone to my guitar amp so I can play with the music. There's either a lot of static or it gets very very quiet and you have to wiggle the base of the wire to get it working again, which sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, and on top of that makes a very loud buzz whenever attempting to do this."
"It worked in a pinch, but as advertised it seemed like a great idea that it would break away when hit.  Well I put it together and the side clasps that should break away hold it together way too tight.  I had to file the plastic down myself. Just an extra step I would have rather not done.  It was way cheaper to buy it from Amazon thought than through Humminbird"
"It cost way way way to much,Just slides in and the strap they sent with it don't even go with it.??? Very Dumb"
"This came in the mail today. I quickly took off my previous screen protector and applied this one on. I was disappointed because there was the rainbow effect and it made the screen look darker. I thought that it was my fault so i took it off and applied another one really carefully. To my disappointment, there was the rainbow effect again. The little paper that it came with doesn't wipe off dirt and fingerprints that well. I'm really frustrated but I guess you get what you pay for."
"I thought this stated it works for ipod touch.  When I got it, it doesn't work for mine.  I guess this charger doesn't work for a 3rd generation.  I didn't get that info until I received it.  I was told that I could return it and get a refund, but it works on my classic ipods."
"Swimming with music! Wow!... No. I have (had) an iPod nano 5th generation which is the one in the picture. I ordered this product because there were numerous reviews that were great, and only a small handful that were bad. I do triathlons and i figured for training, swimming with music would be so much easier and more fun than staring at the bottom of a pool. This seemed like the perfect thing. I tested it out before hand by letting it soak in a bucket of water with a piece of paper inside. After over 30 mins, i dried the case and checked the paper, all was well. The paper was dry, and I was excited to get in the pool with it. So I go swimming and it's the best swim ever! I swam a fast 600 yards and stopped to look down at my iPod. I notice water seeping in through the edges... long story short, after one time of swimming in the pool with it, it leaked and ruined my iPod. I even put my iPod in rice, but it was too late. I definitely could have gotten a defect case, but I was extremely unhappy with what happened with mine. Luckily the company did refund my money, so, all I lost out of this was my iPod."
"I purchased this for my iPad2 but it woudn't charge it.  It works for my son's iPod, which is good I guess.  Now I can't charge my iPad2 on the go."
"I paid $49.99 for this unit on sale, and for a $50 stereo it is AMAZING.<br /><br />It plays songs off my 8gb USB flash drive flawlessly, the pre-set equalizer settings are good, the ease of operation is fantastic. I have over 150 albums on that flash drive, and with this receiver sorting by artist, then album, and having fast load times and a clear display of what it's loading, it's easy to get to what I want to hear, or I can set it to shuffle and it's awesome about not playing the same songs twice.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are that it won't charge a phone you're playing music from through the USB port (my HTC EVO 4G went dead while plugged in), and the sound quality when playing the music from my phone via USB wasn't nearly as good as what it is from my flash drive (occaisional skips and gaps).<br /><br />I work for a car dealership, and when we get trade-ins that don't have radios or have radios that don't work, this is what we now install.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I've had this unit in my truck for several months now, and still, to date, have no issues with it. I drive down rough roads, race the truck, and otherwise subject this radio to harsh conditions that could cause problems and it continues to work great.<br /><br />EDIT: After about a year, the display failure mentioned in other reviews happened to me. It's really a shame, as it was otherwise a great little unit!"
"Can't find albums, can't select music I want. No instruction manual. Stops playing in the middle of a song (good battery charge).  Not worth the postage to return it."
"First of all, I ordered the blue color and thy sent me the white case. The white case wasn't as good ad the picture shows ;/"
"When I first got this transmitter, I was very impressed by the fact that I was getting a great little transmitter for 10 bucks. However, this little guy only lasted about 2 weeks. After two weeks, the transmitter started acting up by giving me alot of static and hissing. For whatever reason, if you don't plug this into your car, it won't give you a clear signal - I think it has something to do with poor grounding. Regardless, I think the power cable started to crap out on me, because it would only charge intermittently and the signal quality got worse and worse, regardless of what frequency I was on.    It worked great for 2 weeks though, and considering how awesome Amazon is with their return policy, I think it was worth it for me. But if you dont want to deal with the hassle, steer clear of this guy."
"The volume was poor, so much so that I had to turn the car stereo volume all the way up to hear the mp3 and then I'd hear tons of static and other noise which drowned out the sounds of MP3. Also, the unit would fall out of the outlet when I hit any road bumps, which caused the unit to turn off and I'd get blasted by the car stereo since I had the speakers set so high. I tried it with my MP3 player, my phone, and my kindle.  NOthing worked with this product."
"I LOVED this case when it first got here, but the silicon outside slowly stretched util the point of it being unusable."
I don't know what's wrong with it but you cant even understand the audio of this product. I will buy a better quality next time.
"While the charger works in the home, in the car and on a 9v battery, it does not charge the ipod touch. And while in the car, you cannot have the music through your car speakers using this."
"The protetive skin fits too loose around the zune.  I have a 120G zune and was disappointed because it doesn't wrap snuggly around it.  I guess it's ok because hopefully it will do the job since it doesn't seem like it's going to come undone, but unfortunately, I don't like it that much.  However, I'm glad to have it in order to help protect it somewhat."
"This was soooo junky, I wish I had spent a little more money & got something nicer."
"I order this item but the in-dash gps/dvd I received was of a different (updated) model. The shipment of the item came earlier than expected but that would be the only high point - when inserting a movie in the dvd player the picture would always show a dark/grimy image with little option to correct it, ipod feature didn't work properly like misspelling some songs names and only playing songs in folders that were already open upon connecting to the system, system clock resetting every time you turn off the car and also not matching up with the gps internal time. There is more but suffice to say that I was disappointed and returned the item."
"This item would appear to be perfectly built, with a great universal fit. The problem is that since it is entirely plastic, it degrades in heat and may, as mine did, break apart like a sugar sculpture right out of the box.  If it doesn't fall apart immediately, it will definitely degrade sitting in the extreme heat of your car, so if you buy this item, make sure you always remove it when your car will be outside for any length of time. The seller, Charger City, issued us a full and speedy refund, and I would buy from them again, just not this item. If you think a $20 mount is sufficient for a $500 piece of equipment, you'll be as disappointed as I was."
So far this item has not done what I bought for. I have not given up trying but I will need to talk to the manufacture of the product and the manufacture of my blue tooth speaker to see if I am doing anything wrong in set up.
"My daughter wanted this for her birthday (12/20) After looking at it on 11/30 and wondering if it was worth the price I ordered it for her, as most fathers cannot deny their daughters. I was notified on 12/2 that it had shipped was expected to arrive by 12/22. It was coming from NY. How far away is that? Her birthday came and went. Christmas came and went, no 15 Item Accessory Bundle. When it did arrive on the 28th. (It was shipped on the 26th.) Different seller than what is listed now. I was not at all happy. Some of the items in the picture were not in the package. It seemed that the seller had just grabbed some loose stock and threw it in a mailer. What was included seem to be poor quality to me. I gave it to my daughter despite my misgivings. She seem to be pleased, although not as happy as I had hoped she would be when I placed the order. As far as I know she has not used any of the items yet and she might not have any trouble with them. I was just disappointed with the outward quality of most of the items. I can not believe what I ordered was worth the price I payed.    There was no invoice or any other papers in the package I received, nor had I received any communications from the seller after several attempts from me to find out when I could expect the items to arrive.    All of these items might do what they are supposed to do, I hope they do, even though the whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth."
"This is a fine CD player with adequate sound and definition for its size. To reasons for the two stars: the instructions and sysrem for playing MP3 CDs are not imtuitive and complex, and the diagram of folder hierarchies are hard with NO explanation, if not nearly impossible to follow. This is the main reason I purchased this, so I could play custom-made discs for my 95 year old mother. Next is the hard-to-read display for repeating discs or tracks. This is a poor performance for Sony."
"Quality is not good, in fact it has already broken but it was inexpensive so what do you expect? Meh"
"The velcro arm fastening is way too large for my arm. (Even when worn over a jacket sleeve.)  I will probably have to sew addtional velcro on the strap in order to wear it on my arm.<br />It is easy to get the ipod into the armband, but quite difficult to get the ipod back out again."
"Everything this device does, it did well. Held my iPhone 4S well, charged it, radio worked perfectly clear even over strong stations.  I drive a 2010 Audi A4.<br /><br />the main reason I bought this was to hold my phone for Car navigation. Unfortunately, somehow this device scrambles my GPS and makes it useless. for this reason, the main reason i bought this device, i can't give it a good review.<br /><br />if you don't need gps, seems to work well. But i cant speak for the long term use quality since I could only try it for a couple of days."
"The only reason I bought this case was to be able to prop it up with the stand. However, when you try to prop it up, the stand slowly collapses and the iPod falls down. Fail. The only reason I didn't give this one star was that the rest of the cover fits well with a pretty color (although it was more red than the picture shows), and the anti-glare guard was nice and easy to apply. So, if you want a cover with a stand that does its job, don't buy this."
REALLY disappointed that iXCC has changed around the size of the plastic tip on the lightning end and made it larger than the previous ones they sold. I bought this to fit my LifeProof Fre case for my iPhone 6 and it won't fit. I was going to send them back but I wound up swapping them with my wife who has a different phone case that will work with the larger tips. If you own a LifeProof Fre case DO NOT buy these power cords! Otherwise they work fine but I'm taking 3 stars off for increasing the size of the lightning tip housing.
I bought this to improve the radio reception on my Harley because I removed the tour pak. I really doesn't do much to improve the reception.
"Product functioned as i needed it to. until it fell apart. The end that connects to the iphone separated while I was trying to plug it in. I guess I shouldn't expect much from something in this price range, and it did do what I wanted it to as long as it could, I will be looking for competitors products for longevity now."
Did not maintain pair even when my phone was right next to the speaker
Bought this for my Garmin Zumo. This shade does not fit well on the GPS and if used on a motorcycle it will fly off.
First off It came really fast! Super happy with that. Only bad part is im not sure if I got a broke speaker or what but my cell phone is way louder. Kinda makes this buy suck
Theses are VERY rainbowy. I kept getting distracted whenever the screen was white. it also tints the screen a lot
"The first one I bought was defective, and had to be exchanged. The second one was fine, until the clip broke off, at which time I almost lost it. The volume does not go very high, so my attempts to drown out the noise of crying babies on the bus was unsuccessful with this player. And after just a year, the battery won't hold a charge anymore. I saw that this item was rated 5 stars, and had to leave my comments. Actually, I own the maroon model, but still, I will not buy another Sansa."
"This I Retrofone/Charger is rickety at best. It is difficult getting the phone out of the charger and you must take it out of even the slimest case to charge it. It is also a bit awkward in size, would crack easily and is made of inferior plastic."
"Original Post:The Good:<br />Has a very clear picture. It's the perfect size. Very functional at first and works with the Free Registrator software to show both the Video and the GPS.<br /><br />The not so Good:<br />It can't seem to get it together when the SD card gets full. Instead of smoothly writing over the older files, it stops taking video and when you try to start it again a couple of error messages that are too small to read flash momentarily on the tiny screen and then it just sits there smiling at your frustration. If you try to play the last clip it recorded on Registrator you get a yellow corrupted file notification.<br /><br />The only fix I have found for this is to put the card in your computer and erase everything and start again. Not the way it's supposed to work obviously, but you could carry a laptop around and erase the SD card every 5 hours or so. I got the best results (If you could call it that) with a Samsung 32GB Class 10 card although the manual says not to use a 10.. go figure!<br /><br />I see one guy on U-tube who has tried about a million firmware changes plus dropping it off the Empire State building to no avail. It's made in China so calling for customer service would be about the same as the Empire State drill.<br /><br />I think if you get the right firmware to start with and the chinese guy was having a good day you would have a great camera.<br /><br />But it's kind of like Russian Roulette.. Good Luck.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/30/14- After installing New Firmware 20140116 camera is working flawlessly. Overwrites video as it should<br />which was my main problem, allows miles per hour instead of Kilometers, works perfectly with Registrator software<br />and shows GPS movement on the map. Everything is now functioning perfectly."
"While the charger works sometimes, more often than not I get a \\""charger not compatible\\"" sign on my phone.  Very disappointed that the product doesn't work as advertised."
I was very disappointed at quality of the product.  The velcro broke off as soon as I tried to open it.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the company was quick to respond with a refund.  Don't waste your time or money on this product.  Go for something better.
"These are the best ear buds I've found. They fit. They don't fall when I run. They're comfortable. I am so glad to have found them.<br /><br />Edited 4/24/14: A few months later, the rope part frayed (not sure what the best word is here?) and left the cord exposed. It ruined the sound. I bought another pair but the same thing happened. Not sure if I just used them too hard (though I would say a normal amount since all I did was run), but I'm pretty bummed that it happened not once but twice. They were good while they lasted!"
"while the device worked, it was good, suddenly stopped..."
Not so good edges don't want to stay stuck down  Have the same problem with the laptop version of this skin
"Way thin and cheaply made. Searched far and wide, quality VHS clamshell cases must be a thing of the past."
Not well built. Control buttons clumsey.
"This was my second iHome clock radio. My old one was retired because the spin dials on the top stopped working. Loved it at first. Amazing sound. The radio was a bust, as it picked up about 3 stations. Never used it as an alarm clock, so I have no input there. What started happening after a few months was when I would put the iPod onto the connector, it said it was in iPod mode... but there was no sound. Radio setting on, no sound. Aux setting on, no sound. After fidgeting with it 35 times, the sound would come back. It got to the point where I had to repeatedly connect the ipod, take it off, over and over and over again before any sound would come from the speakers. I should have returned it when I had the chance. I should've taken the $110 bucks I spent on it and lit it on fire. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.<br /><br />I will NEVER EVER EVER purchase another iHome product."
"The Kobo Touch runs far better than its button WIFI predecessor, but - unfortunately - it is just as inclined to screen failure.<br /><br />I originally bought a WiFi Kobo for DH at a Borders with extra warranty, and it died in less than 4 months of gentle usage. Screen developed these funny bars etc. I didn't pursue it immediately because I thought the chain closing meant I was out of luck but folks online told me otherwise. After dealing with their unwieldy & inefficient (but polite - then) 'tiered' system eventually I found Kobo would exchange it if I covered the shipping & insurance to Canada. Sadly the refurbished they sent was also a lemon (screen issue - lines & bars again in weeks), and so was the one after that. At least we were given a domestic address the last time!<br /><br />In March of this year they sent a refurbished Kobo Touch. This was an upgrade that made us willing to forgive all the nonsense we'd gone through before - until this week, when it broke too (That's 5 months of gentle use. A new record!) DH took it out of its out-sized extra protective case in a waiting room and found 1/4 of the screen was frozen on the 'powered off' image. When he got home, and powered up it up again, half the screen was now unreadable, as another quarter only changed from dark to light areas.<br /><br />Now the rep says it is out of warranty. He's counting from the original lemon's purchase date. So that's that.<br /><br />[Rep added a snark about how nobody would have done any better. He claimed that if you returned a bad TV to Fry's they wouldn't extend the warranty. I replied that you could take a bad TV right back into Fry's and get a new one that worked, not wait months for a refurbished model that you could only hope was truly fixed -  after paying more shipping!]<br /><br />Bottom line- all the 'refurbished' units they sent were not-so-fixed lemons AND they now run the warranty out from the original purchase date. They are also disregarding how long it took them to respond and then finally exchange the units.<br /><br />All the money I spent sending those stupid lemons back could have bought us another Nook or Kindle AND it would still be working! (Our family's other e-readers are doing fine.) All this hassle doesn't make me want to buy another Kobo, that's for sure.<br /><br />Review!<br /><br />The Kobo Touch is nice while it lasts, though not great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Shows several books you are reading at once for easy access. Speed is better than previous models though not quite as fast as the Nook or Kindle. Fonts and contrast are competitive, quite good actually. Page-turn speed was acceptable, when it didn't freeze up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Breaks easily! Customer support very slow - at best, rude and unhelpful - at worst. Battery was a bit weird, sometimes claiming it needed to be charged when it had just been charged - other times it ran as long as they claimed.

"I tried to install the plastic shield two times (after carefully cleaning the screen) and both times it was overwhelmed by bubbles under the plastic. Either my room is full of dust (doubtful), the product is impossibly difficult to install or I am a klutz. You choose!    I took the phone to the Verizon store and they installed another brands that worked - more expensive, but worth it."
"The frame is small, I knew it when I purchased it. It was a replacement for a  dash cam with a 1/2 larger screen. The directions are a little difficult to understand. It doesn't pick up sound & I can't figure out how to adjust it. The camera came set on a language that was very foreign, & took awhile to get to the menu to switch to English.  I suppose it will serve the purpose, but the previous dash cam was better & easier to work & download."
"I've had my PRS-T1 for just under 6 months. The Wi-Fi has stopped functioning and won't detect any networks. When I undertook to have it repaired or replaced under warranty, I discovered that the warranty was barely there.  If I was willing to settle for trading for a refurbished model, it would cost me $30. If I wanted to have mine repaired, it would cost me a minimum of $25 plus shipping, and I wouldn't have it for however many weeks it took. If the problem required replacing the screen, that was not covered and would be extra.<br /><br />Either way, the rest of the warranty vanishes, to be replaced by 90-day P&L coverage.  Sony should be utterly ashamed of themselves for this alleged warranty. Since this device costs about $40 more than most of its competition, that is inexcusable.<br /><br />The display is more grey than white, but you do get used to this.  The touch-screen is iffy, sometimes recognizing a swipe, sometimes not. I've learned to just use the \\""next page\\"" button.<br /><br />Forget the software that comes with it. The Sony software just blows. Hard to think how it could be worse. Fortunately, there's a freeware program out there, Calibre, that is better by leaps and bounds, and is also superb at doing conversions from Mobi (Kindle) format and others.<br /><br />PDF is another popular format, but it's pretty bad on every reader I've seen -- most computer screens, too. There are very few books I'd suffer through PDF to read, most of them I'd rather do without than put up with it. Professional ebook publishers don't use it. PDF conversion is extremely difficult for anybody, and extremely problematic -- you've got to babysit the conversion and clean up all the dumb mistakes.<br /><br />The Sony doesn't require you to divulge all sorts of personal information to sign up for a required account whether you want one or not, doesn't require you to agree to 160+ pages of legalese (B&N Nook), and doesn't contain software to \\""unsell\\"" something you thought you had purchased (Kindle). This puts it ahead of either competitor.<br /><br />Battery life is to die for. Plugging it in to my computer's USB port to load a book also recharges it, so in those 6 months it has only complained about needing a recharge twice.<br /><br />Once you get accustomed to the way Calibre does things, it does them with the Sony better than it does them with any other reader.  This will really organize your library conveniently. It uses \\""tags\\"" or \\""collections\\"", so you can tag a book in multiple genres, multiple subjects, etc., in Calibre and then find them that way on the Sony.<br /><br />I should mention that the Sony \\""keyword\\"" system does not work at all, is not described in the user manual and doesn't work. Apparently Sony never actually implemented it and just left the remnants behind.<br /><br />The device runs Android, so it can be rooted and modified. One of the most useful mods (doesn't require rooting) is to change the list of \\""recently added\\"" books, to \\""recently read\\"". (Changing what they are, not what the screen label says.)<br /><br />If you read multiple books at once, or need a reference handy all the time, or share the device with a spouse, this is invaluable. You have four books available at a touch, from the home page.<br /><br />You can also root it completely, which makes the library of Android applications available.<br /><br />The device runs into difficulties if the SD card gets up above 32 GB in actual content, slowing down a bit, so that should be the upper limit.  The case for the reader needs pockets for SD cards, a significant lack.<br /><br />The case's light has glare issues, requiring that the light be moved here for the top half, there for the bottom half of the page. Because of those two things I discommend the case and suggest you look at third-party products instead.<br /><br />If you're going to get one of these things, get a Square Trade warranty to go with it as soon as you purchase it. If you have any problems that should be far better than Sony's vanishing so-called warranty."
"I had bought this item new two years ago, and it worked wonderfully.  After it was stolen during a home robbery I wanted to replace it and thought a refurbished model would work as well as my new one had.  Wrong!!  The radio reception is just not good, and since I use it for listening to the radio as much as for listening to music, this is definitely a problem."
I bought the speaker because I had purchased a smaller one a few years before that  had great sound. It had stopped working so I decided to get another one. This one doesn't have the great bass the other one had and tends to be fuzzy. I am disappointed in the new one.
"Case was a sloppy fit for the Kindle. Kept sliding out and the bottom seam blocked using the lower keys on the keyboard.The outside appeared durable leather, but the inside was made of cheap plastic which was pealing. I eventialy ordered another case for the Kindle in genuine leather from another supplier to Amazon.The old addage\\""you get what you pay for\\"" applies in this case."
"this product does not show tv ,it is not an American tv system so NO channel will work . please do worst our money. try everything to make tv work. but everything else do word like radio , games etc."
I ordered the iPod Video/Classic Black Silicone Skin Case with Armband and got something completely different(Black Neoprene Sporty ArmBand for iPod Video/Classic).
Very hard to solder the required joints and reseal the 305. It seems to be near impossible to cram this battery in the 305 as it it slightly bigger than the OEM version
I loved this cable until it broke in less that 3 months. The end that plugs into the iPod broke apart as I was disconnecting it. Luckily I got it out with no damage to my iPod. I was always careful removing it for fear of this. So in no way could I have done anything else to prevent this other than never disconnecting it and that would not ever be an option. Hoping I can find another cable like this for my iPod touch. Sounds way better than headphone jack. I do not have the capability of controlling through my headunit so I needed this type of cable. If anyone knows of one please send me a message.
It records....sometimes. Tends to shut it self off more often than not. It also jumps to different settings when I click on the settings button to erase the recording so that it can start anew. So I have to play around with the settings to eventually get to the one that I want. It's super annoying and so is the continuous turning on/off cycle.
This product is not the same as the image.  The edge of the battery extender is curved on the ends rather than straight across where it connects to the iPod.  You cannot connect it to the iPod when the case is on the iPod.  You must take the case off before connecting the battery extender.  If it was straight across like the picture I would be able to use it with the case because I have another one that works that way.  I wanted this one because it has the 'pass through' cable connection for the iPod/USB cable.
This converter is cheaply made . The plastic buttons feel like they may be easy to break but otherwise it seems to work
"Rubber bands were of poor quality and broke after just a couple of uses. Sorry, but just providing honest feedback."
If you have an otter box on your iPhone this cable will not work.  I don't want to have to take off the box every time just to use it.  Would have been great but it wasn't.  I couldn't get it to work now it's just a calbe.
"When it records it is great.  But after a couple of weeks it began to stop recording randomly.  I would reset it and it would start recording again, but then stop.  Flaky."
"What was received was not exactly as the original motor pod (my term).  My X1 motor pod has a flange that will accept a screw to attach the cover .  What was received was different in that the flange was rotated 90 degrees and seem to be made to snap on to the cover.  I made it work with tape, but I could have done that with the broken one I had."
Weak reception - No external antennea<br />Not loud enough even on a Honda 750 with stock exhaust.<br />No Hardwware in the box.<br />External USB case was separated<br />USB will not charge a Blackberry Bold.<br /><br />Aux-in sounded ok.<br /><br />I may build a small stereo amplifier or I will send them back.
"In case you did not know Apple has come up with a new Ipod Nano, so there is no point of getting an out of date product."
This case is almost impossible to remove once put on your ipod. It blocks it from being pluged into speakers or wall chargers as well. I would not recommend this.
"It says \\""easy two wire install\\"" before assembly required?!<br />I hope no one tries to break into the car while I put this thing together.<br /><br />The quality appears good tho, and the shipping was fast."
"The first one leaked in my pocket, destroying a shirt. It was a very hot day, though.<br /><br />The second one is prone to smearing ink all over the pen and my fingers."
The quality of the material is poor. it felt like it was hoing to break. I would not recommend this product.
"i installed this into my vehicle and it was Very easy, just plug and play, the adapter that goes into your car charger port disconnected from the wire within a week, the connection is very poor and it just fell right out and i was unable to fix it. looked amazing while it was up but would highly reccomend that you choose from a different company to get your moneys worth."
"Great as a bright flashlight and ok for charging devices.<br /><br />However, after about a month of normal use it stopped holding its own charge.<br /><br />The Micro USB ports wouldn't read any phone."
"This is an old car charger with a lightning adaptor, why not just by the adaptor and reuse your old charger?"
No instructions/paperworks that came with so It is hard to program. I transfer the old electrionic portion/inside part of the old the remote to the new case just to make it work.
"This device stopped working after about 3 days of use. It did not turn on, despite additional charging. The device does not have a &#34;reset&#34; button of any sort so doing a hard reset (which it probably needed) was impossible and I had to return it. Amazon, of course, did a great job on the return process."
"This was a really tight fit in my iPod, but it did work fine for about three days. It broke in only a couple of uses. Like it didn't just stop working, the cord and the actual part you plug into the iPod just came apart."
I bought one of these as my first sub. I powered it with a cheap boss amp and it hit fairly well. As i learned more about subs i realized that i was missing alot of beats because there was not enough power running to it. I got a real amp fosgate 1200.1 which should of still been within the acceptable rms power handleing of this sub. Long sfory short it blew within a week. Do not buy anything that isn't certified to be the actual power rateing that it is.
They don't get over 1/2 mile distance.
Disappointing.
"these bearings arent good. they didnt last me long, it lasted me for like a week and 4 already broke"
"Well i have only had this for 8 days (November 18, 2010 - November 25, 2010) the screen protector is awesome quality (5 Stars), you can't even tell it's there! However, the silicone case is poor quality. It fitted nicely on my ipod when i first put it on.. then after a few days it started stretching out and lifting off my ipod. I can't tell you about the arm band because i threw it away the day i received the kit in the mail.. but i wouldn't even use it anyways because it will just stretch out the silicon case and possibly rip it.    I hope this was helpful and sorry for my english and punctuation.. and happy thanksgiving!"
very nice but it takes too long til i got it..
"I can't believe I didn't read the 2 star review on Amazon before purchasing this product.<br />Got one through J&R for $134, which is not a bad deal but this thing can't do anything without the remote control...."
"The covers fit too tight on the top of my Ipod Touch4.  It seems as if the cover push down the on/off button. At this point it gives the display to \\""cancel\\"" on the home screen for some reason. Since this happens every time I use one of these covers I no longer can use them. With that being said I feel like I wasted my money :("
I brought this item when it first came out. Nice unit but it has problems with the USB conectors. I returned it.
"This were great, but they are more problem than anything.<br />The screen is extremely hard to see even indoors, and to top it off, it peels off waaay to easily.<br /><br />The price was decent for it though.<br />I wouldnt suggest it for the iPhone, but for the iTouch or any regular iPod (I placed one on my iPod Classic)<br />It works great. From there on, keep shopping."
"I was hoping to be able to use this to charge my iPod while we backpacking on the Appalachian trail... no love! It worked the first time as a backup battery because I'd already given it a full charge from the usb on my computer. It never worked as a solar charger... in fact, I left it in the sun (like I figured you were supposed to do with a solar charger) and it started to discolor some of the input/output options on the back. By the third day (I'm a dreamer) I couldn't even tell if the thing was charging or not because back-lit indicator light had changed and faded so much."
"i got this thing and it worked alright, it was not real clear and then after two weeks it just stopped working. it will play for about ten seconds then just stop. the price is great but their is a reason for that"
"So I bought this item with the hopes that the battery would last for a bit.  Well I got this on 9/28/11 and it now there are battery issues.  If you turn it on and off a certain amount of times - doesnt MATTER how long you listen to it in between shutting it on and off, it will not turn back on until you plug it into a power source.  The battery somehow goes from full to dead.    I guess that's what I get for buying a refurbished one.  I've been an avid fan of Creative Labs.  I've had the Zen Touch 20GB, X-fi Style, Xfi Style 300, Zen and they've all crapped out on me. The only problem I had with them in the past (which still exists) is their crappy bloatware.  But if they can't manufacture something that is hardware stable....  I've decided to go with another company that has good battery life and plays music."
"The battery power does not perform as advertised. Go figure, false advertising, yeah right. You are lucky to get 1 1/2 hours of video play instead of approx. 6 as promised. Also, something about the codec makes any video I load onto it makes the audio video sync off. I might, one day just leave it out for someone else to &#34;find&#34; and fuss over till they decide to give it to some toddler to slobber and teethe on."
Doesn't work! I guess u get what u pay for
"Pretty disappointed.  The leather cover edges do not extend beyond the iPad's, so if I drop it I'll still get a broken iPad.  The straps to secure the iPad into the cover are also rather loose, so a big strip of leather covers part of the screen (you can't see the black bar with the clock when held horizontally).   Leather itself seems fine, although I wish it were less puffy.  This iPad isn't so thin anymore once it's in the cover on it."
I find many things wrong with this case for the UV-82 series radio.  I find that the belt clip that is attached to the radio has to be removed before you put in this pouch.  That needs to be corrected.  The belt clip on the pouch is ok but I would never trust it to keep attached to my belt or pocket.  This also needs to be corrected.  The piece of plastic and snap for across the top of the radio also needs to be replaced with a much better retention system like shock cord and a fastex buckle.  The elastic on the sides of the case to allow for expansion is already pulling apart from the stitching and I just got it in the mail today.  Many major flaws with this case all the way around.
I purchased this item as a x-mas gift for my daughter; I did not realized until much later that the cd stopped playing after a few weeks. I have purchased other Philips brand items and got similar results. I'm under the impression that Philips is letting the quality of everyday electronics fall down the cliff.
"Right after installation, within first Summer, the Plastic Screw Cracked. It will not HOLD the metal screw inside.  Tried to remove adhesive, still left some highly visible ugly spots!! NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!"
"I just received this with my new Kindle 3 after ordering them last week. This literally swallows the new Kindles. I do not see how this could at all provide adequate protection for the smaller model. If you have a K2, the case itself looks to be well made and of a good quality, it was just not at all designed for the K3. I will be returning mine today to get one actually built for my kindle."
"MyTouch 4g - pairs as a headset, but not media audio, so the mp3 player in the phone doesn't work.<br /><br />Nuts, as this charger is quiet, and I like the steering controls :("
"Go to the dollar store and buy one instead of this one the remote only changes the volume not the channels, you have to do that with the wheel on the side..and I bought it because it hangs on the wall so I wanted it up out of the way so it is very inconvenient to have to reach up there to change the channels..not that it really picks up many channels it has a lot of static and noise, and does not pick up well..I bought my Granddaughter one at the dollar store that was much nicer and plays better for less money and she loves it..so it was a waste of my money.."
"After four weeks of usage it started to make clicks during the song plays. Comparing to other products it is very cheap one so this is why I bought it. But the quality of sound is also not good anymore. I would not recommend to buy it. Pay more money , but get something more reliable."
See the HEADING has been Changed since I purchased mine...Would have bought this item. I wanted to buy a 800 watt Unit..<br />OH well my mistake I guess...
"They gone on easy,the protect all this is true you can use your machine just not in the light Don't go into the light!"
"I like it, it allows me to play music in my car without having access to my cd player. However, the device slides and leans and turns with the movement of the car"
"just a plain old normal screen protector. Cheap, but NOT reusable... i went through the whole pack to find ONE that didnt have dust"
"The item is as described, I bought two. One works the second one died after two uses. If you need one that you can depend on don't buy this one"
The Armband is excellent but the plastic covering is falling apart after 3 weeks of use in the gym.  The plastic covering is seperating from the relective portion. Outside of that it works great!
I would have bought these but for $2.00 more I found a pair of 6x9's rated 1200 watts max and they're 6 ways.
the gps mount broke the first time I installed it. Luckily I had the spare one from Garmin and it fit
"I was really looking for a high quality case at a great price as my other case became water damaged.... if that is what you are looking for... look elsewhere.  If you are simply looking for something to get the job done.. this will.  I selected the green one and the color is true to the picture.  My original case dried out and is actually ok, so I went back to it... it is a Belkin of the same style... I would suggest paying extra and getting one of those if you want something that is nice and durable."
I purchased this for my mother being that she has a hard time hearing things. All she could hear was the constant chirping of this device. It made more noise than the noise it was suppose to pick up. I would not purchase it.
"If you have all your music on SD card or USB device this is great but you can not get good reception with the FM feature,it is a little weak on the volume if you have other than stock exhaust."
"i could not get this product to work for my galaxy note very well.the note seemed to heavy for it.the price was right,tho it diddnt work for me....it might do better on a different phone."
"I bought two of these, the first one paired up and worked very easily.  The voice activation recognition and sound quality are off a bit though. It misunderstands you a lot and then tells you Next time say call name mobile one, why do I have to add Mobil one to the stored name?? none of my blue tooth equipped cars do anything like that. At least it works though.<br /><br />The second one paired with the phone fine but the voice activation would not work at all. Very Frustrating. tried to pair it with another phone to test it and it would not pair with that phone, odd. I think it is defective.<br /><br />trying to return the second one, but after 14 days, don't know if I can or not.<br /><br />At this point I could not recommend this product."
"Mine arrived in 3 pieces (i think someone forgot to screw in some of the screws)  After assembling it, I loaded a bunch of songs on my USB drive and inserted it in the player and plugged it in the socket closest to the dashboard radio. I tested it on several different radio stations.  You can distinctly hear the timer processor at all times and all volumes clicking constantly regardless of the station frequency.  Also, It does not seem to be able to find all the tracks I loaded on the USB.  The remote is helpful in that once you know the track number of a song you can select that track directly.  There is no random function. When the power is shut off the unit re-sets so you have to start from the beginning and set it back up. The eq function changes the sound to different degrees of weird distortion. This is really a piece of junk."
"I ordered this product from PE - Pyrus Electronics.  It is advertised to have both digital video recording capability and a digital camera.  The product I received was this product, but WITHOUT the digital video recorder or digital camera, making it nothing more than a cheaply made and glorified MP3 Player.    The instruction manual that comes with it is horrible and is obviously written by someone who does not speak or write fluent english.  You need to go to the website for [...] and click on \\""download and support\\"" if you want an actual manual that gives you good instructions.  Also, DO NOT use the disc that comes with the Player UNTIL you have gone and gotten the manual from that website.  If you do so, you could screw the Player up.    The video player is not that great of quality, the sound quality is not that great, and this product is not that easy to figure out how to use (especially if you have never owned an MP3 Player before).    This product can not be operated correctly without getting the updated manual that DOES NOT come with it.    It would probably be a nice product if it contained an updated manual in it.  That is, assuming you are sent the model that you ordered..."
These are ok but do not stay on the pproduct when being used by kids.  Probably a better product for adults.
Like any other chinese goods this is one of them. Piece of s***.
