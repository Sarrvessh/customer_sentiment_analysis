    "original_text": "Here is another great product I discovered to use with my Note 2.  This particular unit has a very portable footprint and it's relative slim with dimension of 119mm x 74mm x 18mm (4.7\\\\\" x 2.9\\\\\" x 0.7\\\\\"). It's also pretty lightweight for 7000 mAh capacity, at 6.8 oz (193 g). It's definitely very comfortable and pocket/purse friendly. As a matter of fact, this unit is actually intended to be used on the go where you don't even have to worry about power cables since it has built in full usb cable for Input charging (a fast 5V, 1A port) and also micro-usb cable for one of the Output charging ports (5V, 1A). In addition to 1A output port with micro-usb cable, it also provides 2 additional usb ports with 2.1A and 1A outputs. These got you covered for any smart phone or tablet, and can also charge two devices at the same time.<br /><br />For convenience if input charging cable is not long enough for you, New Trent also included USB extension chord which I found to be a great bonus. No other chords or adapters were included with this product. The device itself is very slick with a footprint reminding me a small external hard drive. The bottom of this power bank is finished matte while the top has a shiny piano finish. On the top you also have a discretely placed power button and 4 led power meter indicators with cool green lights. Those 4 lights partition power reading into 25% increments.<br /><br />Beside its portability and convenience of built in cables, the main attraction of this device is a whooping 7000 mAh capacity. This is some serious number!!! And NT70T has this 7000 mAh speced at 3.7V - the voltage of the actual lithium battery. To be honest, I was a little skeptical at first because external battery market is flooded with a lot of high capacity external batteries that have exaggerated labels. So right away I put this battery to the test. I had my Note 2 discharged down to 25% while NT70T was charged all the way to full (4 leds lit up). I used 2.1A output port fora faster charging and used my own usb-to-micro-usb cable. My Note 2 battery got charged up to 100% in under 3 hours. That was very impressive. After charging it up, I checked with NT70T and it still had 3 leds on!!!! Of course, 3 leds doesn't mean it's at full 75% charge, but rather between 50% and 75% charge. But still, very impressive considering we are talking about our GN2 with 3100 mAh stock battery. As a bonus, you can actually charge your phone while charging NT70T, pretty cool although not recommended by manufacturer since it can accelerate aging of the battery.<br /><br />In my opinion this is one of the top small footprint portable external battery chargers that offers simultaneous charging of two devices at the same time with one port being 2.1A and others at 1A, and having a whooping true 7000 mAh capacity!!! A must have if you need a portable backup battery and don't wont to part with your current smart phone case (to accommodate bulky extended battery). I definitely recommend NT70T EasyPack!",

I read through all of the 'small print' and decided to purchase a 3 year policy that included Accidental Breakage.  Until now I did not need to use the policy, but when the camera was not taking photographs that were up to the quality I was used to, I chose to send it in to Nikon for repair.  Within a couple of days of receiving the repaired camera Square Trade had reimbursed the full amount of the repair.  I had one call to Square Trade and could not have been more satisfied.  My iPad and 2 other camera lenses are also insured with Square Trade.  I have peace of mind!  Thank you Square Trade!!!",

Until now I didn't need to use the policy, but when the camera was not taking photos that were up to the quality I used to, I chose to send it in to Nikon for repair. Within a couple of days of receiving the repaid camera Square Trade had reimbursed the full amount of the repair. I had one call to Square Trade and could not have been more satisfied. My iPad and 2 other camera lenses are also insured with Square Trade. I have peace of mind! Thank you Square Trade!!!",

My Zune HD slid inside beautifully and seems pretty happy - not a really tight fit, as the case would probably have with an Apple product, but a comfortable fit. I won't be just tossing the case into my purse because the Zune would probably eventually slide out, but tucked into a pocket of any purse it would be just fine.    I'd like to add that Proporta is a great company to interact with. Their package came to me with the contents hand-written, and a small present comes wrapped up in the invoice :) Thoughtful and fun, and refreshing in these modern times.",

    "original_text": "You're actually getting 3 products here- a shoe pouch to  hold the Nike+ transmitter, an armband to hold your Ipod (with or without your Nike+ plugged in), and also a screen protector for your Ipod.     Pros- Seller was awesome helping me confirm I was ordering the correct item to fit my generation of Ipod Nano. This was the hardest part for me. The shoe pouch is laced into your shoes & then velcros closed & seems very secure so I don't worry I'll lose the transmitter with this at all. The armband doesn't bother me when I run but it might for some that are sensitive to it. It's very adjustable for different arm sizes (my arms are small & it works great). I like that the Ipod holder is made from a smooth silicone material & is easy to plug in my my Nike + into the Ipod.  Easy to take the armband off & on. Also comes with a screen protector for the Ipod. Comes with great instructions that are easy to follow to adjust armband, put on screen protector, & lace up shoe pouch. I have not had any problems with my Nike+ finding/reading my transmitter in my shoe or the accuracy but I'm not someone that  takes my distance too seriously. (You do need to calibrate your Nike+ (instructions on Nike website) to make it more accurate.) Works fine for my weekly 5k runs!    Cons- The pouch has to be laced into the shoe which is somewhat time consuming so not good if you want to quickly remove the shoe pouch or wear your running shoes without the pouch on it a lot. (It is easy to remove the transmitter chip inside however- since it just velcros closed.) Also the pouch is not water-proof. As for the Ipod holder on the armband- the silicone Ipod holder part seems like it could tear easily if you are not careful inserting & removing your Ipod. Includes instructions that explains how to avoid that. (I wouldn't recommend this product if you won't be keeping your Ipod in the silicone skin most the time for that reason.) The screen protector was not really exciting for me but I guess it's a nice added bonus.     Overall these are great quality products for the price & I don't run without them!",

It's compact, easy to carry, looks good, and not very heavy. I am fond of the glossy black look, even though it attracts smudges, but it's very easy to wipe off. I especially like the built-in USB cables.  They not only look nice on the pack, but they are extremely handy for charging the device and my cell phone without having to plug in cables, and they fit on the sides of the device perfectly. The two USB ports and built-in cables are labeled on the device and very easy to read. The included USB extended cable is good quality and very appreciated.  The packaging of the device in the plastic box is top notch. Very classy and appealing to me.<br /><br />It charges my Samsung Galaxy Tab Plus from 50% to full charge in 2 hours and 15 minutes, and I can get two charges to my Tab with it. It will charge my Galaxy Tab, my cell phone, and my Phillips Mp3 player together, and I can use my tablet as it charges if I want to.<br /><br />It took 7 hours, 30 minutes to charge the device from 0% to full using the AC adapter that came with my Galaxy Tab, and 8 hours to charge using my laptop USB. Ideal to charge overnight.<br /><br />This is the thing that really impressed me though...I charged the device to 100% four days ago, and haven't used it since. Before I wrote this review, I was curious how much it might have discharged in four days. When I connected it to my laptop USB, I still had four solid green bars! No noticeable discharge at all!<br /><br />I am impressed with the New Trent products, and their customer service is the best I ever dealt with. I highly recommend the NT70T. It really is darn near perfect.",

The cameras, ear plug, and charge port are not blocked and easily accessed. We do not dock our iPods, so I can't comment there. The case has withstood a drop to the kitchen floor and patio.

    "original_text": "I use this device to transmit a DirecTV satellite receiver output to my earbuds (plugged into a cheap $24.00 Bluetooth audio adapater from Wally World), about 15' across the room. The manual says to keep the transmitter within 5 feet of the receiving device, which, if that were the case, I would have returned it. At 15' there is no breakup or background noise. The audio quality is far superior to what I had been using: an FM transmitter (common for car stereo setups) to a Sony Walkman am/fm radio on FM. While the latter setup works, there is a lot of background noise and cross/same channel interference because the Sony FM portable receives so many FM stations that there is always interference. Also, moving around (like rolling over), causes the signal to come and go on FM, hence my desire to try a Bluetooth solution)<br /><br />This is where Bluetooth comes in. No interference whatsoever, No problem pairing this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World Bluetooth receive adapter (which also works very, very well). I am taking the line level out of the DirecTV receiver and using the supplied adapter cable that came with the transmitter to get the audio from the sat receivre to the transmit adapter. I leave the transmit adapter plugged in all the time to the provided charging cable (a simple USB wall charger). On the receive side, the Wally World receive adapter is also powered all the time. Both devices appear to have an internal Li-ion battery, but they can both be left on charge power during normal use without risk to the batteries.<br /><br />The transmit adapter is about 1\\\\\" square and 1/8\\\\\" thick, weighs next to nothing. The cheap Wally World receive adapter is very similar in size and weight, and it has the standard 1/8\\\\\" (3.5 mm) stereo jack output)<br /><br />If you want to duplicate this setup, keep in mind we are using \\\\\"line level\\\\\" audio, so there is no volume control. As it turns out, the audio level is perfect for night time listening with just a common setof \\\\\"Frogz\\\\\" ear buds. If I felt I needed volume control, I could find a set a ear buds with built in volume control, but so far, there is no need. The line levels are quiet enough to not \\\\\"keep me awake\\\\\", but certainly loud enough for clearly understandable  dialog.<br /><br />N.B. Concerning the \\\\\"delay\\\\\" referenced in other reviews: Using it on the DirecTV sat receiver, there is a perceptible delay, but it is very, very slight. If I look really hard to spot this \\\\\"issue\\\\\", I can see it now and then...and to be honest, that problem manifests all on its own from DirecTV without any bluetooth transmitter. Nevertheless, there is \\\\\"some\\\\\" delay, however slight, but not enough to confuse or even mildly annoy me. Further, I got it to \\\\\"fall asleep\\\\\" to, so most of the time I have the TV off when listening to this setup. I did make a point, however, of evaluating the delay carefully before writing this review. It is possible that each device may show differing delays, but I don't see the kind of delays that some have written  about. Maybe I will in the future, but so far, there just isn't any issue. Maybe the pairing of this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World receiver adapter is just a happy marriage. Who knows?<br /><br />Highly recommended (both transmitter and receiver).",
