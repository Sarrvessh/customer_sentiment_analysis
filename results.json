I think the rubber-like edge gives extra protection to the phone too.  I noticed fairly quickly that dust and such was able to get inside the case, so I ended up putting a screen protector on the back of my iPhone so that the dust would not scratch the glass.  Next, the rubber like edge began to stretch, and I could feel the phone actually moving inside the case. I hardly ever took the phone out of the case, so this did not happen due to removing the phone frequently. Finally, it is June of 2011, and I noticed that the rubber like edge has started to separate from the hard carbon fiber etch back piece.  I have dropped the phone a couple of times, but no farther than about a foot or two, and probably only about 3 times during this total time.  This could account for the break between the rubber edge and the hard back piece, but my opinion is that the case did not hold up well with even very careful use.  I will not be purchasing the same case as a replacement.\"\n",

Otherwise it functions fine.

The instructions I used (below) used both the supplied tape (almost all of it) and a bit of super glue. I opted out of the super glue and just used tape.    The blue color is perfect for my son-- really electric blue.--his favorite. I did notice that the screen is a bit harder to keep clean though. There is either a residue still on it from the manufacturing process or it's simply a cheaper grade of glass. Oh... and before I finished the install and removed the protecting plastic from the digitizer (the silver part on the underside) I noticed some scuffs that I couldn't blow off. Not sure if this will effect performance in the long run. Again, cheap Chinese replacement parts.    Here's a link of the install instructions I followed. It was very comprehensive--perhaps making me slow down so I was sure not to make a costly mistake.\"",

    "original_text": "\"Gin Rummy is one of my favorite card games.  A few days ago, after getting tired of the online games that are on the Internet, I started a search for an application that I could run locally on my computer.  This turned out to be a not-so-easy task.  When you do a search for gin rummy software, there are a lot of sites that offer \\\\\"\"free\\\\\"\" software.  I recommend being very careful about which \\\\\"\"free\\\\\"\" sites you click on.  Anything listed as free on the Internet has a good chance of having some nasty stuff inside.<br /><br />I finally settled on this program because I just didn't like the other ones I'd tried.  Many of them have interfaces that don't look good and many lack flexibility to be able to play the game as though you were using an actual deck of cards.<br /><br />I found this program on the Bicycle cards web site.  You can purchase it and download it from the web site.  One downside is the software is not shareware.  You either have to buy it or you don't get to try it.  Once the program is loaded, be prepared for the application to do some weird things to your monitor.  Like so many graphic-based games, this one doesn't run well on the high resolution Windows desktop right out of the box.  If you have a display like mine, which is 1680 x 1050, go to the program settings and run the application from a window.  By doing this, the program won't change your screen resolution.<br /><br />When you get the program going, the graphics are quite good.  In fact the cards look like real cards and the animation is quite impressive.  The game makes you choose which cards to put in your melds.  If you don't properly lay down your melds, the game will count the cards as deadwood.  It takes a little bit to figure out how to lay down the cards.  Watching the tutorial was helpful.<br /><br />There are a few things I don't like about this application.  Even though you can supposedly enter your own name as the human player, during actual game play, you are always Damien.  I've gone back to the settings section and it still has the name I entered, but in the game, I am Damien.  There are only two ways that the program will let you arrange cards, by rank or by suit.  You cannot group melds together in your hand unless they end up being together under the 2 sorting schemes.  So you have to really pay attention to the cards.  On more than one occasion, I've discarded a card I didn't mean to because the card wasn't grouped in the meld.  The game does not allow going \\\\\"\"Big Gin.\\\\\"\"  You must discard when going out, so big gin isn't possible.  And my final complaint is that the program requires you to completely close the application after a match.  Then you have to restart the program to continue play.<br /><br />When this program is compared with the others that are out there, it's not bad.  If you want to play Gin Rummy locally on your computer, this is the best there is.  Just remember that it isn't anywhere near 5 stars.ll has the name I entered, but in the game, I am Damien.

    "original_text": "Here is another great product I discovered to use with my Note 2.  This particular unit has a very portable footprint and it's relative slim with dimension of 119mm x 74mm x 18mm (4.7\\\\\" x 2.9\\\\\" x 0.7\\\\\"). It's also pretty lightweight for 7000 mAh capacity, at 6.8 oz (193 g). It's definitely very comfortable and pocket/purse friendly. As a matter of fact, this unit is actually intended to be used on the go where you don't even have to worry about power cables since it has built in full usb cable for Input charging (a fast 5V, 1A port) and also micro-usb cable for one of the Output charging ports (5V, 1A). In addition to 1A output port with micro-usb cable, it also provides 2 additional usb ports with 2.1A and 1A outputs. These got you covered for any smart phone or tablet, and can also charge two devices at the same time.<br /><br />For convenience if input charging cable is not long enough for you, New Trent also included USB extension chord which I found to be a great bonus. No other chords or adapters were included with this product. The device itself is very slick with a footprint reminding me a small external hard drive. The bottom of this power bank is finished matte while the top has a shiny piano finish. On the top you also have a discretely placed power button and 4 led power meter indicators with cool green lights. Those 4 lights partition power reading into 25% increments.<br /><br />Beside its portability and convenience of built in cables, the main attraction of this device is a whooping 7000 mAh capacity. This is some serious number!!! And NT70T has this 7000 mAh speced at 3.7V - the voltage of the actual lithium battery. To be honest, I was a little skeptical at first because external battery market is flooded with a lot of high capacity external batteries that have exaggerated labels. So right away I put this battery to the test. I had my Note 2 discharged down to 25% while NT70T was charged all the way to full (4 leds lit up). I used 2.1A output port fora faster charging and used my own usb-to-micro-usb cable. My Note 2 battery got charged up to 100% in under 3 hours. That was very impressive. After charging it up, I checked with NT70T and it still had 3 leds on!!!! Of course, 3 leds doesn't mean it's at full 75% charge, but rather between 50% and 75% charge. But still, very impressive considering we are talking about our GN2 with 3100 mAh stock battery. As a bonus, you can actually charge your phone while charging NT70T, pretty cool although not recommended by manufacturer since it can accelerate aging of the battery.<br /><br />In my opinion this is one of the top small footprint portable external battery chargers that offers simultaneous charging of two devices at the same time with one port being 2.1A and others at 1A, and having a whooping true 7000 mAh capacity!!! A must have if you need a portable backup battery and don't wont to part with your current smart phone case (to accommodate bulky extended battery). I definitely recommend NT70T EasyPack!",

I read through all of the 'small print' and decided to purchase a 3 year policy that included Accidental Breakage.  Until now I did not need to use the policy, but when the camera was not taking photographs that were up to the quality I was used to, I chose to send it in to Nikon for repair.  Within a couple of days of receiving the repaired camera Square Trade had reimbursed the full amount of the repair.  I had one call to Square Trade and could not have been more satisfied.  My iPad and 2 other camera lenses are also insured with Square Trade.  I have peace of mind!  Thank you Square Trade!!!",

My Zune HD slid inside beautifully and seems pretty happy - not a really tight fit, as the case would probably have with an Apple product, but a comfortable fit. I won't be just tossing the case into my purse because the Zune would probably eventually slide out, but tucked into a pocket of any purse it would be just fine.    I'd like to add that Proporta is a great company to interact with. Their package came to me with the contents hand-written, and a small present comes wrapped up in the invoice :) Thoughtful and fun, and refreshing in these modern times.",

    "original_text": "You're actually getting 3 products here- a shoe pouch to  hold the Nike+ transmitter, an armband to hold your Ipod (with or without your Nike+ plugged in), and also a screen protector for your Ipod.     Pros- Seller was awesome helping me confirm I was ordering the correct item to fit my generation of Ipod Nano. This was the hardest part for me. The shoe pouch is laced into your shoes & then velcros closed & seems very secure so I don't worry I'll lose the transmitter with this at all. The armband doesn't bother me when I run but it might for some that are sensitive to it. It's very adjustable for different arm sizes (my arms are small & it works great). I like that the Ipod holder is made from a smooth silicone material & is easy to plug in my my Nike + into the Ipod.  Easy to take the armband off & on. Also comes with a screen protector for the Ipod. Comes with great instructions that are easy to follow to adjust armband, put on screen protector, & lace up shoe pouch. I have not had any problems with my Nike+ finding/reading my transmitter in my shoe or the accuracy but I'm not someone that  takes my distance too seriously. (You do need to calibrate your Nike+ (instructions on Nike website) to make it more accurate.) Works fine for my weekly 5k runs!    Cons- The pouch has to be laced into the shoe which is somewhat time consuming so not good if you want to quickly remove the shoe pouch or wear your running shoes without the pouch on it a lot. (It is easy to remove the transmitter chip inside however- since it just velcros closed.) Also the pouch is not water-proof. As for the Ipod holder on the armband- the silicone Ipod holder part seems like it could tear easily if you are not careful inserting & removing your Ipod. Includes instructions that explains how to avoid that. (I wouldn't recommend this product if you won't be keeping your Ipod in the silicone skin most the time for that reason.) The screen protector was not really exciting for me but I guess it's a nice added bonus.     Overall these are great quality products for the price & I don't run without them!",

It's compact, easy to carry, looks good, and not very heavy. I am fond of the glossy black look, even though it attracts smudges, but it's very easy to wipe off. I especially like the built-in USB cables.  They not only look nice on the pack, but they are extremely handy for charging the device and my cell phone without having to plug in cables, and they fit on the sides of the device perfectly. The two USB ports and built-in cables are labeled on the device and very easy to read. The included USB extended cable is good quality and very appreciated.  The packaging of the device in the plastic box is top notch. Very classy and appealing to me.<br /><br />It charges my Samsung Galaxy Tab Plus from 50% to full charge in 2 hours and 15 minutes, and I can get two charges to my Tab with it. It will charge my Galaxy Tab, my cell phone, and my Phillips Mp3 player together, and I can use my tablet as it charges if I want to.<br /><br />It took 7 hours, 30 minutes to charge the device from 0% to full using the AC adapter that came with my Galaxy Tab, and 8 hours to charge using my laptop USB. Ideal to charge overnight.<br /><br />This is the thing that really impressed me though...I charged the device to 100% four days ago, and haven't used it since. Before I wrote this review, I was curious how much it might have discharged in four days. When I connected it to my laptop USB, I still had four solid green bars! No noticeable discharge at all!<br /><br />I am impressed with the New Trent products, and their customer service is the best I ever dealt with. I highly recommend the NT70T. It really is darn near perfect.",

The two USB ports and built-in cables are labeled on the device and very easy to read. The included USB extended cable is good quality and very appreciated. The packaging of the device in the plastic box is top notch. Very classy and appealing to me.<br /><br />It charges my Samsung Galaxy Tab Plus from 50% full charge in 2 hours and 15 minutes to get it on the device, and I can disbr it with my battery with my battery, but I would have",

The cameras, ear plug, and charge port are not blocked and easily accessed. We do not dock our iPods, so I can't comment there. The case has withstood a drop to the kitchen floor and patio.

    "original_text": "I use this device to transmit a DirecTV satellite receiver output to my earbuds (plugged into a cheap $24.00 Bluetooth audio adapater from Wally World), about 15' across the room. The manual says to keep the transmitter within 5 feet of the receiving device, which, if that were the case, I would have returned it. At 15' there is no breakup or background noise. The audio quality is far superior to what I had been using: an FM transmitter (common for car stereo setups) to a Sony Walkman am/fm radio on FM. While the latter setup works, there is a lot of background noise and cross/same channel interference because the Sony FM portable receives so many FM stations that there is always interference. Also, moving around (like rolling over), causes the signal to come and go on FM, hence my desire to try a Bluetooth solution)<br /><br />This is where Bluetooth comes in. No interference whatsoever, No problem pairing this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World Bluetooth receive adapter (which also works very, very well). I am taking the line level out of the DirecTV receiver and using the supplied adapter cable that came with the transmitter to get the audio from the sat receivre to the transmit adapter. I leave the transmit adapter plugged in all the time to the provided charging cable (a simple USB wall charger). On the receive side, the Wally World receive adapter is also powered all the time. Both devices appear to have an internal Li-ion battery, but they can both be left on charge power during normal use without risk to the batteries.<br /><br />The transmit adapter is about 1\\\\\" square and 1/8\\\\\" thick, weighs next to nothing. The cheap Wally World receive adapter is very similar in size and weight, and it has the standard 1/8\\\\\" (3.5 mm) stereo jack output)<br /><br />If you want to duplicate this setup, keep in mind we are using \\\\\"line level\\\\\" audio, so there is no volume control. As it turns out, the audio level is perfect for night time listening with just a common setof \\\\\"Frogz\\\\\" ear buds. If I felt I needed volume control, I could find a set a ear buds with built in volume control, but so far, there is no need. The line levels are quiet enough to not \\\\\"keep me awake\\\\\", but certainly loud enough for clearly understandable  dialog.<br /><br />N.B. Concerning the \\\\\"delay\\\\\" referenced in other reviews: Using it on the DirecTV sat receiver, there is a perceptible delay, but it is very, very slight. If I look really hard to spot this \\\\\"issue\\\\\", I can see it now and then...and to be honest, that problem manifests all on its own from DirecTV without any bluetooth transmitter. Nevertheless, there is \\\\\"some\\\\\" delay, however slight, but not enough to confuse or even mildly annoy me. Further, I got it to \\\\\"fall asleep\\\\\" to, so most of the time I have the TV off when listening to this setup. I did make a point, however, of evaluating the delay carefully before writing this review. It is possible that each device may show differing delays, but I don't see the kind of delays that some have written  about. Maybe I will in the future, but so far, there just isn't any issue. Maybe the pairing of this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World receiver adapter is just a happy marriage. Who knows?<br /><br />Highly recommended (both transmitter and receiver).",

    "original_text": "Here is another great product I discovered to use with my Note 2.  This particular unit has a very portable footprint and it's relative slim with dimension of 119mm x 74mm x 18mm (4.7\\\\\" x 2.9\\\\\" x 0.7\\\\\"). It's also pretty lightweight for 7000 mAh capacity, at 6.8 oz (193 g). It's definitely very comfortable and pocket/purse friendly. As a matter of fact, this unit is actually intended to be used on the go where you don't even have to worry about power cables since it has built in full usb cable for Input charging (a fast 5V, 1A port) and also micro-usb cable for one of the Output charging ports (5V, 1A). In addition to 1A output port with micro-usb cable, it also provides 2 additional usb ports with 2.1A and 1A outputs. These got you covered for any smart phone or tablet, and can also charge two devices at the same time.<br /><br />For convenience if input charging cable is not long enough for you, New Trent also included USB extension chord which I found to be a great bonus. No other chords or adapters were included with this product. The device itself is very slick with a footprint reminding me a small external hard drive. The bottom of this power bank is finished matte while the top has a shiny piano finish. On the top you also have a discretely placed power button and 4 led power meter indicators with cool green lights. Those 4 lights partition power reading into 25% increments.<br /><br />Beside its portability and convenience of built in cables, the main attraction of this device is a whooping 7000 mAh capacity. This is some serious number!!! And NT70T has this 7000 mAh speced at 3.7V - the voltage of the actual lithium battery. To be honest, I was a little skeptical at first because external battery market is flooded with a lot of high capacity external batteries that have exaggerated labels. So right away I put this battery to the test. I had my Note 2 discharged down to 25% while NT70T was charged all the way to full (4 leds lit up). I used 2.1A output port fora faster charging and used my own usb-to-micro-usb cable. My Note 2 battery got charged up to 100% in under 3 hours. That was very impressive. After charging it up, I checked with NT70T and it still had 3 leds on!!!! Of course, 3 leds doesn't mean it's at full 75% charge, but rather between 50% and 75% charge. But still, very impressive considering we are talking about our GN2 with 3100 mAh stock battery. As a bonus, you can actually charge your phone while charging NT70T, pretty cool although not recommended by manufacturer since it can accelerate aging of the battery.<br /><br />In my opinion this is one of the top small footprint portable external battery chargers that offers simultaneous charging of two devices at the same time with one port being 2.1A and others at 1A, and having a whooping true 7000 mAh capacity!!! A must have if you need a portable backup battery and don't wont to part with your current smart phone case (to accommodate bulky extended battery). I definitely recommend NT70T EasyPack!",

My Zune HD slid inside beautifully and seems pretty happy - not a really tight fit, as the case would probably have with an Apple product, but a comfortable fit. I won't be just tossing the case into my purse because the Zune would probably eventually slide out, but tucked into a pocket of any purse it would be just fine.    I'd like to add that Proporta is a great company to interact with. Their package came to me with the contents hand-written, and a small present comes wrapped up in the invoice :) Thoughtful and fun, and refreshing in these modern times.",

    "original_text": "You're actually getting 3 products here- a shoe pouch to  hold the Nike+ transmitter, an armband to hold your Ipod (with or without your Nike+ plugged in), and also a screen protector for your Ipod.     Pros- Seller was awesome helping me confirm I was ordering the correct item to fit my generation of Ipod Nano. This was the hardest part for me. The shoe pouch is laced into your shoes & then velcros closed & seems very secure so I don't worry I'll lose the transmitter with this at all. The armband doesn't bother me when I run but it might for some that are sensitive to it. It's very adjustable for different arm sizes (my arms are small & it works great). I like that the Ipod holder is made from a smooth silicone material & is easy to plug in my my Nike + into the Ipod.  Easy to take the armband off & on. Also comes with a screen protector for the Ipod. Comes with great instructions that are easy to follow to adjust armband, put on screen protector, & lace up shoe pouch. I have not had any problems with my Nike+ finding/reading my transmitter in my shoe or the accuracy but I'm not someone that  takes my distance too seriously. (You do need to calibrate your Nike+ (instructions on Nike website) to make it more accurate.) Works fine for my weekly 5k runs!    Cons- The pouch has to be laced into the shoe which is somewhat time consuming so not good if you want to quickly remove the shoe pouch or wear your running shoes without the pouch on it a lot. (It is easy to remove the transmitter chip inside however- since it just velcros closed.) Also the pouch is not water-proof. As for the Ipod holder on the armband- the silicone Ipod holder part seems like it could tear easily if you are not careful inserting & removing your Ipod. Includes instructions that explains how to avoid that. (I wouldn't recommend this product if you won't be keeping your Ipod in the silicone skin most the time for that reason.) The screen protector was not really exciting for me but I guess it's a nice added bonus.     Overall these are great quality products for the price & I don't run without them!",

It's compact, easy to carry, looks good, and not very heavy. I am fond of the glossy black look, even though it attracts smudges, but it's very easy to wipe off. I especially like the built-in USB cables.  They not only look nice on the pack, but they are extremely handy for charging the device and my cell phone without having to plug in cables, and they fit on the sides of the device perfectly. The two USB ports and built-in cables are labeled on the device and very easy to read. The included USB extended cable is good quality and very appreciated.  The packaging of the device in the plastic box is top notch. Very classy and appealing to me.<br /><br />It charges my Samsung Galaxy Tab Plus from 50% to full charge in 2 hours and 15 minutes, and I can get two charges to my Tab with it. It will charge my Galaxy Tab, my cell phone, and my Phillips Mp3 player together, and I can use my tablet as it charges if I want to.<br /><br />It took 7 hours, 30 minutes to charge the device from 0% to full using the AC adapter that came with my Galaxy Tab, and 8 hours to charge using my laptop USB. Ideal to charge overnight.<br /><br />This is the thing that really impressed me though...I charged the device to 100% four days ago, and haven't used it since. Before I wrote this review, I was curious how much it might have discharged in four days. When I connected it to my laptop USB, I still had four solid green bars! No noticeable discharge at all!<br /><br />I am impressed with the New Trent products, and their customer service is the best I ever dealt with. I highly recommend the NT70T. It really is darn near perfect.",

The cameras, ear plug, and charge port are not blocked and easily accessed. We do not dock our iPods, so I can't comment there. The case has withstood a drop to the kitchen floor and patio.

Just like in other 4&5 star reviews, this protector cuts down on the glare as well as reduces the smudging. Great product!",

    "original_text": "I use this device to transmit a DirecTV satellite receiver output to my earbuds (plugged into a cheap $24.00 Bluetooth audio adapater from Wally World), about 15' across the room. The manual says to keep the transmitter within 5 feet of the receiving device, which, if that were the case, I would have returned it. At 15' there is no breakup or background noise. The audio quality is far superior to what I had been using: an FM transmitter (common for car stereo setups) to a Sony Walkman am/fm radio on FM. While the latter setup works, there is a lot of background noise and cross/same channel interference because the Sony FM portable receives so many FM stations that there is always interference. Also, moving around (like rolling over), causes the signal to come and go on FM, hence my desire to try a Bluetooth solution)<br /><br />This is where Bluetooth comes in. No interference whatsoever, No problem pairing this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World Bluetooth receive adapter (which also works very, very well). I am taking the line level out of the DirecTV receiver and using the supplied adapter cable that came with the transmitter to get the audio from the sat receivre to the transmit adapter. I leave the transmit adapter plugged in all the time to the provided charging cable (a simple USB wall charger). On the receive side, the Wally World receive adapter is also powered all the time. Both devices appear to have an internal Li-ion battery, but they can both be left on charge power during normal use without risk to the batteries.<br /><br />The transmit adapter is about 1\\\\\" square and 1/8\\\\\" thick, weighs next to nothing. The cheap Wally World receive adapter is very similar in size and weight, and it has the standard 1/8\\\\\" (3.5 mm) stereo jack output)<br /><br />If you want to duplicate this setup, keep in mind we are using \\\\\"line level\\\\\" audio, so there is no volume control. As it turns out, the audio level is perfect for night time listening with just a common setof \\\\\"Frogz\\\\\" ear buds. If I felt I needed volume control, I could find a set a ear buds with built in volume control, but so far, there is no need. The line levels are quiet enough to not \\\\\"keep me awake\\\\\", but certainly loud enough for clearly understandable  dialog.<br /><br />N.B. Concerning the \\\\\"delay\\\\\" referenced in other reviews: Using it on the DirecTV sat receiver, there is a perceptible delay, but it is very, very slight. If I look really hard to spot this \\\\\"issue\\\\\", I can see it now and then...and to be honest, that problem manifests all on its own from DirecTV without any bluetooth transmitter. Nevertheless, there is \\\\\"some\\\\\" delay, however slight, but not enough to confuse or even mildly annoy me. Further, I got it to \\\\\"fall asleep\\\\\" to, so most of the time I have the TV off when listening to this setup. I did make a point, however, of evaluating the delay carefully before writing this review. It is possible that each device may show differing delays, but I don't see the kind of delays that some have written  about. Maybe I will in the future, but so far, there just isn't any issue. Maybe the pairing of this transmitter with the el cheapo Wally World receiver adapter is just a happy marriage. Who knows?<br /><br />Highly recommended (both transmitter and receiver).",

    "original_text": "Here's an interesting toy that fits the bill to be described as \\\\\"it is what it is\\\\\". It works for the most part as advertised, but probably isn't the ideal I thought it would be. I bought it because Hurricane Sandy had me thinking about how I'd entertain myself should the grid go down. I probably should have saved my money and bought one a little more high-end.<br /><br />When you get it, it's put in a green-friendly box. The one-sheet manual tells you to keep the packaging - the inside of the box has a silvered piece of paper that some videos I've seen on YouTube were using as a screen, and another piece of cardboard that is meant to be used as a stand for the projector. Not the most ideal situation there - I'm expected to carry around cardboard in order to use this effectively? I'd rather just project the image on a light-colored wall.<br /><br />I suppose it's well-built for its size - it's got a aluminum casing protecting the LED and lens.  Lens is focused with a small dial on the top of the unit. Its dimensions are 3\\\\\"x1 1/2\\\\\"x7/8\\\\\".<br /><br />There is no internal speaker - it uses earbuds for audio, which are included. There are some minimal audio controls inside a menu, which, when I played with them, didn't appreciably change the audio coming through the earbuds.  Maybe one of those little powered MP3 speakers would work better? Well, you could hear the audio from MP4 videos played through it anyway.<br /><br />It's powered by a sealed-up rechargeable battery. No provision for external power at all. The picture projected is typical of a tiny projector - brighter the closer you get to the wall (Pretec recommends 9 inches, but in a completely dark room it could probably go a lot bigger. In a not-so-dark room, I could get a decent picture about twice that size.). Also, the MicroSD card that was supposed to be included - wasn't.<br /><br />Testing it with a couple of MP4 videos was a mixed bag. My job is editing video, so I know a little something about making MP4s.  I tried a downloaded video from YouTube, an MP4 of a Hollywood movie I had lying around, and an MP4 I made for a client.  Both the YouTube and Hollywood MP4s played, but with monster digital artifacts. My best guess of why that is is that the MP120 has a 320x240 maximum resolution, and the thing is resizing the videos on the fly.That happened on both the 320x240 YouTube and the 720x480 Hollywood vid.  Pretec does have a downloadable piece of software that's supposed to convert vids to MP4 that I haven't used yet. Maybe that will improve the video (though typically you don't want to recompress an already compressed video)?  The MP4 I made from the client's file one way didn't play at all: make an MP4 from the same file with a different MP4 maker and it played fine. What does that mean? You have to decide.",
    "translated_text": "Here's an interesting toy that fits the bill to be described as \\\\\"it is what it is\\\". It works for most part as advertised, but probably isn't the ideal I thought it would be. I bought it because Hurricane Sandy had me thought about how I would entertain myself should grid go down. I probably should have saved my money and bought one a little more high-end.<br /><br />When you have it, it's put in a green-friendly box. The one-sheet manual tells you to keep the packaging - the inside of the box has a silvered piece of paper that some videos I've seen on YouTube were using as a screen, and another piece of cardboard that is meant to be used as a stand for the projector. Not the most ideal situation there - I'm expected to carry around cardboard in order to use this? I'd rather just get the project on a light-colored wallbr /><br /><br /><br />I guess it's that you't play at the MP4 a lot. You's MP3 a lot of the box.",

The image quality is good and there are many connection ports on the back making it for a very versatile radio. The navigation and DVD works well and the SD card function is decent. This makes for a decent amp and I can notice better sound quality in my speakers. I have not hooked up to a subwoofer, but it appears you can do this as well.<br /><br />That is more or less where it stops. The radio sound is poor quality and the aux volume cannot be controlled from the head unit. Even after turning up my mp3 player to full volume I can still barely hear my music via aux. The clock keeps going back two hours after multiple resets. The SD card audio is great, but there is absolutely no sorting. I currently added 1000 songs to an SD card and sorted by artist, genre, etc. The SD music files on the radio interface merely show up as one large list. I'm not even sure how it is sorted, so it makes it virtually impossible to find music. The bluetooth function for phone calls works great on my end, but I have been told the quality on the receiving end is mediocre to poor. Lastly, I got a different unit than what is pictured here... the unit I received does not even have a brand name and is slightly different. It almost seems to be a better unit in some respects, but considering the poor quality that I received I am not sure.<br /><br />All in all, if you don't mind the above this is a great radio and looks great. The functions that work are great, but the functions that don't make it a non-sale for me. I am currently working with the seller to return. Hopefully, this will not be an issue. So far they seem to be very helpful and even changed my shipping to ship Fedex so it would ship to the correct place. I'm assuming they will not give me any trouble.<br /><br />Will post back if anything else comes up.",

I have also already driven two places that it didn't recognize the address for. Isn't the point of a GPS to get you places that are unfamiliar? We ended up asking for directions on one occasion and on the other occasion we happened to have other people in the care with Google Maps on their iphones and Google Maps got us there.    Overall, we are very disappointed. I wouldn't buy again.",

If your only concern is with SPL, i.e. having a sub that causes hearing loss, head-aches and makes your neighbors yearn for your death, then this is a fantastic choice.  However, if you are actually concerned with the musical quality of your bass then you need to look elsewhere.  This sub doesn't play deep, it doesn't play clean, it simply eminates a tremendous quantity of bass that isn't worth hearing.  The bass reproduced by this sub sounds simply like power converted into sound and not an actual element of music.  I'm sure people who own this sub are very proud of how much it makes the rear-view mirror rattle, as well as the amount of attention they are able to garner as they cruise past wal-mart with the windows down; but I fail to believe anyone really truly enjoys the sound that is created by this discus of decibals.  In short, if you want loud (and all you want is loud), consider getting this sub. If you want a sub that actually sounds good, try kicker/rockford/soundstream/audiobahn/boston or some other brand that realizes bass isn't simply a frequency that makes your trunk sound like the apocolypse is beginning, it's an actual element of music.",

    "original_text": "Updated to include details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.<br /><br />I did research between the Kindle and Sony Touch for awhile, and bought the Touch.  I hadn't really been figuring in the Nook during that time, because I thought it was still $259 and that books were more expensive on the barnes and noble site. But the moment I caught wind of the nook price change.....<br /><br />I quickly packed up the Sony Touch and returned it. Things I didn't like about it:<br />- When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, sluggish bare bones E-reader.<br />- The SONY online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.<br />- I sort of saw my reflection when trying to read on the Sony. Granted, it's no mirror and I might have gotten over it, but with that Nook dangling in the back of my head, I had to switch.<br /><br />For 20 dollar less, I think the Nook is more attractive, better book selection, and has wifi. You don't have to tool around with books on your computer to then put them on your e-reader, which is a pain in the butt.<br /><br />Below is my more indepth comparison of the 3 readers(Sony, Kindle and Nook)if you're interested!<br /> - Nook(N) by barnes & noble<br />- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com<br />- Sony Reader Touch(ST)<br /><br />1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.<br /><br />N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.<br />K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?<br />ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.<br /><br />2. PRICE!<br /><br />N: $149 with wifi<br />ST: 169 NO WIFI<br />K: $139 with wifi(or $189 with wifi and free 3G)<br /><br /> While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.<br /><br />*You can now lend book from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new \\\\\"lend me\\\\\" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two readers you cannot lend at all.<br /><br />*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of $50+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.<br /><br />*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!<br /><br />*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen, it was slow to respond and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.<br /><br />*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.<br /><br />*Yet, the Nook is heavier by 3oz then the Kindle or Sony.<br /><br />*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.<br /><br />*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.<br /><br />On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I even bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. I like using the touch screen to \\\\\"swipe\\\\\" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. one fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.rnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon.

I tested it out before hand by letting it soak in a bucket of water with a piece of paper inside. After over 30 mins, i dried the case and checked the paper, all was well. The paper was dry, and I was excited to get in the pool with it. So I go swimming and it's the best swim ever! I swam a fast 600 yards and stopped to look down at my iPod. I notice water seeping in through the edges... long story short, after one time of swimming in the pool with it, it leaked and ruined my iPod. I even put my iPod in rice, but it was too late. I definitely could have gotten a defect case, but I was extremely unhappy with what happened with mine. Luckily the company did refund my money, so, all I lost out of this was my iPod.",

I drive down rough roads, race the truck, and otherwise subject this radio to harsh conditions that could cause problems and it continues to work great.<br /><br />EDIT: After about a year, the display failure mentioned in other reviews happened to me. It's really a shame, as it was otherwise a great little unit!",

Regardless, I think the power cable started to crap out on me, because it would only charge intermittently and the signal quality got worse and worse, regardless of what frequency I was on.

Very functional at first and works with the Free Registrator software to show both the Video and the GPS.<br /><br />The not so Good:<br />It can't seem to get it together when the SD card gets full. Instead of smoothly writing over the older files, it stops taking video and when you try to start it again a couple of error messages that are too small to read flash momentarily on the tiny screen and then it just sits there smiling at your frustration. If you try to play the last clip it recorded on Registrator you get a yellow corrupted file notification.<br /><br />The only fix I have found for this is to put the card in your computer and erase everything and start again. Not the way it's supposed to work obviously, but you could carry a laptop around and erase the SD card every 5 hours or so. I got the best results (If you could call it that) with a Samsung 32GB Class 10 card although the manual says not to use a 10.. go figure!<br /><br />I see one guy on U-tube who has tried about a million firmware changes plus dropping it off the Empire State building to no avail. It's made in China so calling for customer service would be about the same as the Empire State drill.<br /><br />I think if you get the right firmware to start with and the chinese guy was having a good day you would have a great camera.<br /><br />But it's kind of like Russian Roulette.. Good Luck.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/30/14- After installing New Firmware 20140116 camera is working flawlessly. Overwrites video as it should<br />which was my main problem, allows miles per hour instead of Kilometers, works perfectly with Registrator software<br />and shows GPS movement on the map. Everything is now functioning perfectly.",

    "original_text": "The Kobo Touch runs far better than its button WIFI predecessor, but - unfortunately - it is just as inclined to screen failure.<br /><br />I originally bought a WiFi Kobo for DH at a Borders with extra warranty, and it died in less than 4 months of gentle usage. Screen developed these funny bars etc. I didn't pursue it immediately because I thought the chain closing meant I was out of luck but folks online told me otherwise. After dealing with their unwieldy & inefficient (but polite - then) 'tiered' system eventually I found Kobo would exchange it if I covered the shipping & insurance to Canada. Sadly the refurbished they sent was also a lemon (screen issue - lines & bars again in weeks), and so was the one after that. At least we were given a domestic address the last time!<br /><br />In March of this year they sent a refurbished Kobo Touch. This was an upgrade that made us willing to forgive all the nonsense we'd gone through before - until this week, when it broke too (That's 5 months of gentle use. A new record!) DH took it out of its out-sized extra protective case in a waiting room and found 1/4 of the screen was frozen on the 'powered off' image. When he got home, and powered up it up again, half the screen was now unreadable, as another quarter only changed from dark to light areas.<br /><br />Now the rep says it is out of warranty. He's counting from the original lemon's purchase date. So that's that.<br /><br />[Rep added a snark about how nobody would have done any better. He claimed that if you returned a bad TV to Fry's they wouldn't extend the warranty. I replied that you could take a bad TV right back into Fry's and get a new one that worked, not wait months for a refurbished model that you could only hope was truly fixed -  after paying more shipping!]<br /><br />Bottom line- all the 'refurbished' units they sent were not-so-fixed lemons AND they now run the warranty out from the original purchase date. They are also disregarding how long it took them to respond and then finally exchange the units.<br /><br />All the money I spent sending those stupid lemons back could have bought us another Nook or Kindle AND it would still be working! (Our family's other e-readers are doing fine.) All this hassle doesn't make me want to buy another Kobo, that's for sure.<br /><br />Review!<br /><br />The Kobo Touch is nice while it lasts, though not great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Shows several books you are reading at once for easy access. Speed is better than previous models though not quite as fast as the Nook or Kindle. Fonts and contrast are competitive, quite good actually. Page-turn speed was acceptable, when it didn't freeze up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Breaks easily! Customer support very slow - at best, rude and unhelpful - at worst. Battery was a bit weird, sometimes claiming it needed to be charged when it had just been charged - other times it ran as long as they claimed. Touch screen worked fine in some sessions but took several tries to get a response other times (frozen?), which was mildly annoying.hem to respond and then finally exchange the units.<br /><br />All the money I spent sending those stupid lemons back could have bought us another Nook or Kindle AND it would still be working!

    "original_text": "I've had my PRS-T1 for just under 6 months. The Wi-Fi has stopped functioning and won't detect any networks. When I undertook to have it repaired or replaced under warranty, I discovered that the warranty was barely there.  If I was willing to settle for trading for a refurbished model, it would cost me $30. If I wanted to have mine repaired, it would cost me a minimum of $25 plus shipping, and I wouldn't have it for however many weeks it took. If the problem required replacing the screen, that was not covered and would be extra.<br /><br />Either way, the rest of the warranty vanishes, to be replaced by 90-day P&L coverage.  Sony should be utterly ashamed of themselves for this alleged warranty. Since this device costs about $40 more than most of its competition, that is inexcusable.<br /><br />The display is more grey than white, but you do get used to this.  The touch-screen is iffy, sometimes recognizing a swipe, sometimes not. I've learned to just use the \\\\\"next page\\\\\" button.<br /><br />Forget the software that comes with it. The Sony software just blows. Hard to think how it could be worse. Fortunately, there's a freeware program out there, Calibre, that is better by leaps and bounds, and is also superb at doing conversions from Mobi (Kindle) format and others.<br /><br />PDF is another popular format, but it's pretty bad on every reader I've seen -- most computer screens, too. There are very few books I'd suffer through PDF to read, most of them I'd rather do without than put up with it. Professional ebook publishers don't use it. PDF conversion is extremely difficult for anybody, and extremely problematic -- you've got to babysit the conversion and clean up all the dumb mistakes.<br /><br />The Sony doesn't require you to divulge all sorts of personal information to sign up for a required account whether you want one or not, doesn't require you to agree to 160+ pages of legalese (B&N Nook), and doesn't contain software to \\\\\"unsell\\\\\" something you thought you had purchased (Kindle). This puts it ahead of either competitor.<br /><br />Battery life is to die for. Plugging it in to my computer's USB port to load a book also recharges it, so in those 6 months it has only complained about needing a recharge twice.<br /><br />Once you get accustomed to the way Calibre does things, it does them with the Sony better than it does them with any other reader.  This will really organize your library conveniently. It uses \\\\\"tags\\\\\" or \\\\\"collections\\\\\", so you can tag a book in multiple genres, multiple subjects, etc., in Calibre and then find them that way on the Sony.<br /><br />I should mention that the Sony \\\\\"keyword\\\\\" system does not work at all, is not described in the user manual and doesn't work. Apparently Sony never actually implemented it and just left the remnants behind.<br /><br />The device runs Android, so it can be rooted and modified. One of the most useful mods (doesn't require rooting) is to change the list of \\\\\"recently added\\\\\" books, to \\\\\"recently read\\\\\". (Changing what they are, not what the screen label says.)<br /><br />If you read multiple books at once, or need a reference handy all the time, or share the device with a spouse, this is invaluable. You have four books available at a touch, from the home page.<br /><br />You can also root it completely, which makes the library of Android applications available.<br /><br />The device runs into difficulties if the SD card gets up above 32 GB in actual content, slowing down a bit, so that should be the upper limit.  The case for the reader needs pockets for SD cards, a significant lack.<br /><br />The case's light has glare issues, requiring that the light be moved here for the top half, there for the bottom half of the page. Because of those two things I discommend the case and suggest you look at third-party products instead.<br /><br />If you're going to get one of these things, get a Square Trade warranty to go with it as soon as you purchase it. If you have any problems that should be far better than Sony's vanishing so-called warranty.",
    "translated_text": "I\u2019ve been able to use my PRS-T1 for just under 6 months. The Wi-Fi has stopped working and won\u2019t detect any network. When I undertook it repaired or replaced under warranty, I discovered that the warranty was only there. If I was willing to settle for a refurbished model, it would cost me $30. If I wanted to have my repaired, it would cost me a minimum of $25 plus shipping, and I would not have it for many weeks it took. If the problem required replacing the screen, which was not covered and would be extra.<br /><br />Therefore, the rest of the warranty was replaced, to be replaced by 90 days P&L coverage.",

I tested it on several different radio stations.  You can distinctly hear the timer processor at all times and all volumes clicking constantly regardless of the station frequency.  Also, It does not seem to be able to find all the tracks I loaded on the USB.  The remote is helpful in that once you know the track number of a song you can select that track directly.  There is no random function. When the power is shut off the unit re-sets so you have to start from the beginning and set it back up. The eq function changes the sound to different degrees of weird distortion. This is really a piece of junk.",

Well, this time, it arrived cracked through the USPS so I contacted them and asked them to ship another---same thing--arrived cracked.  I called them and told them to put it in a box.

    "original_text": "Here's an interesting toy that fits the bill to be described as \\\\\"it is what it is\\\\\". It works for the most part as advertised, but probably isn't the ideal I thought it would be. I bought it because Hurricane Sandy had me thinking about how I'd entertain myself should the grid go down. I probably should have saved my money and bought one a little more high-end.<br /><br />When you get it, it's put in a green-friendly box. The one-sheet manual tells you to keep the packaging - the inside of the box has a silvered piece of paper that some videos I've seen on YouTube were using as a screen, and another piece of cardboard that is meant to be used as a stand for the projector. Not the most ideal situation there - I'm expected to carry around cardboard in order to use this effectively? I'd rather just project the image on a light-colored wall.<br /><br />I suppose it's well-built for its size - it's got a aluminum casing protecting the LED and lens.  Lens is focused with a small dial on the top of the unit. Its dimensions are 3\\\\\"x1 1/2\\\\\"x7/8\\\\\".<br /><br />There is no internal speaker - it uses earbuds for audio, which are included. There are some minimal audio controls inside a menu, which, when I played with them, didn't appreciably change the audio coming through the earbuds.  Maybe one of those little powered MP3 speakers would work better? Well, you could hear the audio from MP4 videos played through it anyway.<br /><br />It's powered by a sealed-up rechargeable battery. No provision for external power at all. The picture projected is typical of a tiny projector - brighter the closer you get to the wall (Pretec recommends 9 inches, but in a completely dark room it could probably go a lot bigger. In a not-so-dark room, I could get a decent picture about twice that size.). Also, the MicroSD card that was supposed to be included - wasn't.<br /><br />Testing it with a couple of MP4 videos was a mixed bag. My job is editing video, so I know a little something about making MP4s.  I tried a downloaded video from YouTube, an MP4 of a Hollywood movie I had lying around, and an MP4 I made for a client.  Both the YouTube and Hollywood MP4s played, but with monster digital artifacts. My best guess of why that is is that the MP120 has a 320x240 maximum resolution, and the thing is resizing the videos on the fly.That happened on both the 320x240 YouTube and the 720x480 Hollywood vid.  Pretec does have a downloadable piece of software that's supposed to convert vids to MP4 that I haven't used yet. Maybe that will improve the video (though typically you don't want to recompress an already compressed video)?  The MP4 I made from the client's file one way didn't play at all: make an MP4 from the same file with a different MP4 maker and it played fine. What does that mean? You have to decide.",

The image quality is good and there are many connection ports on the back making it for a very versatile radio. The navigation and DVD works well and the SD card function is decent. This makes for a decent amp and I can notice better sound quality in my speakers. I have not hooked up to a subwoofer, but it appears you can do this as well.<br /><br />That is more or less where it stops. The radio sound is poor quality and the aux volume cannot be controlled from the head unit. Even after turning up my mp3 player to full volume I can still barely hear my music via aux. The clock keeps going back two hours after multiple resets. The SD card audio is great, but there is absolutely no sorting. I currently added 1000 songs to an SD card and sorted by artist, genre, etc. The SD music files on the radio interface merely show up as one large list. I'm not even sure how it is sorted, so it makes it virtually impossible to find music. The bluetooth function for phone calls works great on my end, but I have been told the quality on the receiving end is mediocre to poor. Lastly, I got a different unit than what is pictured here... the unit I received does not even have a brand name and is slightly different. It almost seems to be a better unit in some respects, but considering the poor quality that I received I am not sure.<br /><br />All in all, if you don't mind the above this is a great radio and looks great. The functions that work are great, but the functions that don't make it a non-sale for me. I am currently working with the seller to return. Hopefully, this will not be an issue. So far they seem to be very helpful and even changed my shipping to ship Fedex so it would ship to the correct place. I'm assuming they will not give me any trouble.<br /><br />Will post back if anything else comes up.",

    "original_text": "First off, you should know that for some people this will be a very good subwoofer.  If your only concern is with SPL, i.e. having a sub that causes hearing loss, head-aches and makes your neighbors yearn for your death, then this is a fantastic choice.  However, if you are actually concerned with the musical quality of your bass then you need to look elsewhere.  This sub doesn't play deep, it doesn't play clean, it simply eminates a tremendous quantity of bass that isn't worth hearing.  The bass reproduced by this sub sounds simply like power converted into sound and not an actual element of music.  I'm sure people who own this sub are very proud of how much it makes the rear-view mirror rattle, as well as the amount of attention they are able to garner as they cruise past wal-mart with the windows down; but I fail to believe anyone really truly enjoys the sound that is created by this discus of decibals.  In short, if you want loud (and all you want is loud), consider getting this sub. If you want a sub that actually sounds good, try kicker/rockford/soundstream/audiobahn/boston or some other brand that realizes bass isn't simply a frequency that makes your trunk sound like the apocolypse is beginning, it's an actual element of music.",
    "translated_text": "First of all, you should know that for some people this will be a very good subwoofer. If your only concern is with SPL, i.e. having a sub that causes hearing loss, head-aches and makes your neighbors yearn for your death, then this is a fantastic choice. However, if you are actually concerned with the musical quality of your bass then you need to look elsewhere. This sub does not play deep, it does not play clean, it simply eminates a tremendous amount of bass that is not worth hearing. The bass reproduced by this sub sounds simply like power converted into sound and not an actual element of music. I\u2019m sure people who own this sub are very proud of how much it makes the rear-view mirror rattle, as well as the amount of attention they are able to garner as they cruise past wal-mart with the windows down; but I don\u2019t believe anyone really enjoys the sound that is created by this discussion of decibals. In short, if you want to loud and all you really do not think that sound is a real sound like a good.",

Also, whenever the ipod is docked and you use the click wheel to advance to a different song the clock returns to flashing 12:00. You have to remove the ipod from the clock to avoid resetting the time.   The sound is OK, not great but OK.

Within a month there were problems with both players. Mine would only play thru one earpiece and then none unless you held the connection piece in the whole time listening, and my boyfriends's started having a tinnie/tinny sound to the music and the radio selection would disappear with the first, the second one did the same as the first and then his earpiece gave out too.

    "original_text": "Updated to include details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.<br /><br />I did research between the Kindle and Sony Touch for awhile, and bought the Touch.  I hadn't really been figuring in the Nook during that time, because I thought it was still $259 and that books were more expensive on the barnes and noble site. But the moment I caught wind of the nook price change.....<br /><br />I quickly packed up the Sony Touch and returned it. Things I didn't like about it:<br />- When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, sluggish bare bones E-reader.<br />- The SONY online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.<br />- I sort of saw my reflection when trying to read on the Sony. Granted, it's no mirror and I might have gotten over it, but with that Nook dangling in the back of my head, I had to switch.<br /><br />For 20 dollar less, I think the Nook is more attractive, better book selection, and has wifi. You don't have to tool around with books on your computer to then put them on your e-reader, which is a pain in the butt.<br /><br />Below is my more indepth comparison of the 3 readers(Sony, Kindle and Nook)if you're interested!<br /> - Nook(N) by barnes & noble<br />- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com<br />- Sony Reader Touch(ST)<br /><br />1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.<br /><br />N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.<br />K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?<br />ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.<br /><br />2. PRICE!<br /><br />N: $149 with wifi<br />ST: 169 NO WIFI<br />K: $139 with wifi(or $189 with wifi and free 3G)<br /><br /> While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.<br /><br />*You can now lend book from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new \\\\\"lend me\\\\\" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two readers you cannot lend at all.<br /><br />*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of $50+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.<br /><br />*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!<br /><br />*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen, it was slow to respond and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.<br /><br />*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.<br /><br />*Yet, the Nook is heavier by 3oz then the Kindle or Sony.<br /><br />*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.<br /><br />*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.<br /><br />On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I even bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. I like using the touch screen to \\\\\"swipe\\\\\" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. one fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.rnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon.

I do triathlons and i figured for training, swimming with music would be so much easier and more fun than staring at the bottom of a pool. This seemed like the perfect thing. I tested it out before hand by letting it soak in a bucket of water with a piece of paper inside. After over 30 mins, i dried the case and checked the paper, all was well. The paper was dry, and I was excited to get in the pool with it. So I go swimming and it's the best swim ever! I swam a fast 600 yards and stopped to look down at my iPod. I notice water seeping in through the edges... long story short, after one time of swimming in the pool with it, it leaked and ruined my iPod. I even put my iPod in rice, but it was too late. I definitely could have gotten a defect case, but I was extremely unhappy with what happened with mine. Luckily the company did refund my money, so, all I lost out of this was my iPod.",

For whatever reason, if you don't plug this into your car, it won't give you a clear signal - I think it has something to do with poor grounding. Regardless, I think the power cable started to crap out on me, because it would only charge intermittently and the signal quality got worse and worse, regardless of what frequency I was on.    It worked great for 2 weeks though, and considering how awesome Amazon is with their return policy, I think it was worth it for me. But if you dont want to deal with the hassle, steer clear of this guy.",

Very functional at first and works with the Free Registrator software to show both the Video and the GPS.<br /><br />The not so Good:<br />It can't seem to get it together when the SD card gets full. Instead of smoothly writing over the older files, it stops taking video and when you try to start it again a couple of error messages that are too small to read flash momentarily on the tiny screen and then it just sits there smiling at your frustration. If you try to play the last clip it recorded on Registrator you get a yellow corrupted file notification.<br /><br />The only fix I have found for this is to put the card in your computer and erase everything and start again. Not the way it's supposed to work obviously, but you could carry a laptop around and erase the SD card every 5 hours or so. I got the best results (If you could call it that) with a Samsung 32GB Class 10 card although the manual says not to use a 10.. go figure!<br /><br />I see one guy on U-tube who has tried about a million firmware changes plus dropping it off the Empire State building to no avail. It's made in China so calling for customer service would be about the same as the Empire State drill.<br /><br />I think if you get the right firmware to start with and the chinese guy was having a good day you would have a great camera.<br /><br />But it's kind of like Russian Roulette.. Good Luck.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/30/14- After installing New Firmware 20140116 camera is working flawlessly. Overwrites video as it should<br />which was my main problem, allows miles per hour instead of Kilometers, works perfectly with Registrator software<br />and shows GPS movement on the map.

    "original_text": "The Kobo Touch runs far better than its button WIFI predecessor, but - unfortunately - it is just as inclined to screen failure.<br /><br />I originally bought a WiFi Kobo for DH at a Borders with extra warranty, and it died in less than 4 months of gentle usage. Screen developed these funny bars etc. I didn't pursue it immediately because I thought the chain closing meant I was out of luck but folks online told me otherwise. After dealing with their unwieldy & inefficient (but polite - then) 'tiered' system eventually I found Kobo would exchange it if I covered the shipping & insurance to Canada. Sadly the refurbished they sent was also a lemon (screen issue - lines & bars again in weeks), and so was the one after that. At least we were given a domestic address the last time!<br /><br />In March of this year they sent a refurbished Kobo Touch. This was an upgrade that made us willing to forgive all the nonsense we'd gone through before - until this week, when it broke too (That's 5 months of gentle use. A new record!) DH took it out of its out-sized extra protective case in a waiting room and found 1/4 of the screen was frozen on the 'powered off' image. When he got home, and powered up it up again, half the screen was now unreadable, as another quarter only changed from dark to light areas.<br /><br />Now the rep says it is out of warranty. He's counting from the original lemon's purchase date. So that's that.<br /><br />[Rep added a snark about how nobody would have done any better. He claimed that if you returned a bad TV to Fry's they wouldn't extend the warranty. I replied that you could take a bad TV right back into Fry's and get a new one that worked, not wait months for a refurbished model that you could only hope was truly fixed -  after paying more shipping!]<br /><br />Bottom line- all the 'refurbished' units they sent were not-so-fixed lemons AND they now run the warranty out from the original purchase date. They are also disregarding how long it took them to respond and then finally exchange the units.<br /><br />All the money I spent sending those stupid lemons back could have bought us another Nook or Kindle AND it would still be working! (Our family's other e-readers are doing fine.) All this hassle doesn't make me want to buy another Kobo, that's for sure.<br /><br />Review!<br /><br />The Kobo Touch is nice while it lasts, though not great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Shows several books you are reading at once for easy access. Speed is better than previous models though not quite as fast as the Nook or Kindle. Fonts and contrast are competitive, quite good actually. Page-turn speed was acceptable, when it didn't freeze up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Breaks easily! Customer support very slow - at best, rude and unhelpful - at worst. Battery was a bit weird, sometimes claiming it needed to be charged when it had just been charged - other times it ran as long as they claimed.

    "translated_text": "The Kobo Touch runs much better than the use of its WIFI button, but - unfortunately - it is just as inclined to screen failure.<br /><br /><br />I originally bought a WiFi Kobo for DH at a Border with extra warranty, and it died less than 4 months of gentle use. Screen developed these funny bars etc. I didn't pursue it immediately because I thought the chain closing meant I was out of luck but people online told me otherwise. After dealing with their unwieldness and inefficient system I found Kobo would exchange it if I covered shipping & insurance to Canada. Unfortunately, the refurbished them also was a lemon (screen lines and bars again in weeks), and I didn't pursue it immediately because I did the chain closing meant.",

    "original_text": "I've had my PRS-T1 for just under 6 months. The Wi-Fi has stopped functioning and won't detect any networks. When I undertook to have it repaired or replaced under warranty, I discovered that the warranty was barely there.  If I was willing to settle for trading for a refurbished model, it would cost me $30. If I wanted to have mine repaired, it would cost me a minimum of $25 plus shipping, and I wouldn't have it for however many weeks it took. If the problem required replacing the screen, that was not covered and would be extra.<br /><br />Either way, the rest of the warranty vanishes, to be replaced by 90-day P&L coverage.  Sony should be utterly ashamed of themselves for this alleged warranty. Since this device costs about $40 more than most of its competition, that is inexcusable.<br /><br />The display is more grey than white, but you do get used to this.  The touch-screen is iffy, sometimes recognizing a swipe, sometimes not. I've learned to just use the \\\\\"next page\\\\\" button.<br /><br />Forget the software that comes with it. The Sony software just blows. Hard to think how it could be worse. Fortunately, there's a freeware program out there, Calibre, that is better by leaps and bounds, and is also superb at doing conversions from Mobi (Kindle) format and others.<br /><br />PDF is another popular format, but it's pretty bad on every reader I've seen -- most computer screens, too. There are very few books I'd suffer through PDF to read, most of them I'd rather do without than put up with it. Professional ebook publishers don't use it. PDF conversion is extremely difficult for anybody, and extremely problematic -- you've got to babysit the conversion and clean up all the dumb mistakes.<br /><br />The Sony doesn't require you to divulge all sorts of personal information to sign up for a required account whether you want one or not, doesn't require you to agree to 160+ pages of legalese (B&N Nook), and doesn't contain software to \\\\\"unsell\\\\\" something you thought you had purchased (Kindle). This puts it ahead of either competitor.<br /><br />Battery life is to die for. Plugging it in to my computer's USB port to load a book also recharges it, so in those 6 months it has only complained about needing a recharge twice.<br /><br />Once you get accustomed to the way Calibre does things, it does them with the Sony better than it does them with any other reader.  This will really organize your library conveniently. It uses \\\\\"tags\\\\\" or \\\\\"collections\\\\\", so you can tag a book in multiple genres, multiple subjects, etc., in Calibre and then find them that way on the Sony.<br /><br />I should mention that the Sony \\\\\"keyword\\\\\" system does not work at all, is not described in the user manual and doesn't work. Apparently Sony never actually implemented it and just left the remnants behind.<br /><br />The device runs Android, so it can be rooted and modified. One of the most useful mods (doesn't require rooting) is to change the list of \\\\\"recently added\\\\\" books, to \\\\\"recently read\\\\\". (Changing what they are, not what the screen label says.)<br /><br />If you read multiple books at once, or need a reference handy all the time, or share the device with a spouse, this is invaluable. You have four books available at a touch, from the home page.<br /><br />You can also root it completely, which makes the library of Android applications available.<br /><br />The device runs into difficulties if the SD card gets up above 32 GB in actual content, slowing down a bit, so that should be the upper limit.  The case for the reader needs pockets for SD cards, a significant lack.<br /><br />The case's light has glare issues, requiring that the light be moved here for the top half, there for the bottom half of the page. Because of those two things I discommend the case and suggest you look at third-party products instead.<br /><br />If you're going to get one of these things, get a Square Trade warranty to go with it as soon as you purchase it. If you have any problems that should be far better than Sony's vanishing so-called warranty.",

    "original_text": "First of all, reading through these reviews, I seriously think that several different versions are being reviewed here. There are people talking about CDs and firmware upgrades, mine did not come with a CD. Some people said that the software only helped if you had Win98, others referred to software that would convert video - I wish it had been included, because it was not easy to find. More on that below.<br /><br />If you are someone who has fairly picky standards for your gadgets, please, save your money and buy an iPod touch. I wish I had. But, my 11 year old thinks it's cool because it has the touch screen, and it does work, so it's not like i can send it back. For the price (around[...] at this writing), it's decent, but it tries to be too many things for that amount of money, and would have been better off if it had done fewer things, and done them better.<br /><br />For those of you, like me, trying to make the best of this gadget, here are some observations and tips:<br /><br />The screen: is not tremendously responsive. Also, the system is extremely laggy. Tap, and wait. Scrolling down the list of files is a bit tricky - tapping the arrows at the top or bottom will make it move down one screen, but might not let you get all the way to the bottom, and if you click once too many, it bounces back up. Carefully click-dragging the scrollbar works, but not well.<br /><br />Music player: no complaints. It's actually kind of nice to navigate by folder rather than by the various meta tags - though if you're used to having those lists by album/artist/genre, well, it could be a little annoying. I'm fine with the folders.<br /><br />FM Radio: why bother? Maybe it gets reception outside, but, I gave up after tuning into the closest/most powerful stations and  getting loads of static.<br /><br />Camera: well, in bright daylight, it is about as good as a mediocre camera phone from a few years ago. If you absolutely must take a picture, it will ... after a while. It really, really lags after you click camera. Video: again, quality similar to an old camera phone. Better than no camera, but not by much.<br /><br />Games: Game, actually. Tetris. Can't figure out if there's a way to 'hurry up' the bricks when they're moving slowly, and without that, I lack the patience to get through the first level at that painfully slow speed. Another why bother.<br /><br />Videos: If you didn't get a CD with some software to convert video, you can download it here:[...](you will want the Sonix7 Pro version). If the video you're converting is in the 16x9 aspect ratio, make sure to select that before encoding, and it will pad the video. [...] is a good resource also, it explains a lot of details about the ROCKCHIP (which this player uses).  Getting the video to actually play is a little tricky, especially if the movie is full-length.  i find it easier to select a tiny short video and then click the forward arrows to get to the larger video, otherwise it seems like it's never going to start.<br /><br />Oh, and the headphones are just terrible.<br /><br />So, with music and video both working at this point, I'm ready to say I'm relatively happy with this little gadget, though I only recommend it if you really, really want a cheap Chinese knockoff and are willing to put up with a very slow, laggy interface, and a *lot* of annoying quirks. It does have a nice screen for watching movies, and it does store a lot of media with the 8GB on board and optional micro SD.<br /><br />Still, I should have held out for an iPod. If nothing else I'd have about 8 hours of my life back, that I spent trying to figure out the video encoding before finally finding the software. Oh well, you live and you learn.

    "original_text": "As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\\\\"newer\\\\\" or \\\\\"better\\\\\" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\\\\"at least\\\\\" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RAX+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RAX+ radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RAX+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RAX+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RAX+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\\\\"AA\\\\\" or \\\\\"AAA\\\\\" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So\\\\\"if\\\\\" you want a \\\\\"pretty\\\\\" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\\\\"pretty\\\\\" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.\\\\\"if\\\\\" you want a \\\\\"pretty\\\\\" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

I used a can of truck bed liner from Rustolium and it it looks great. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it took 15 days to get here. I placed the order on the 19th of one month and finally received it the next month on the 4th. Granted there was a holiday it there, but it said 3-5 days standard shipping.

I like the fact that it was easy to apply and even though I did get a few tiny bubbles on the outside edge, I barely noticed them so its really not a big deal.     The reason I gave it 3stars is because now my screen seems very grainy to me...and it's very annoying.   In fact, I'm not sure I will actually leave the screen protector on just because of this.  Maybe my eyes are just sensitive ....I don't know but its like going from HDTV quality back to standard definition ...adjusting the brightnness didn't seem to clear it up for me.   I just didn't expect this to happen because I have a screen protector on my cell phone and it's perfectly undetectable.  Of course that was a different product though.... Anyway... Im just feeling disappointed.  Another thing I didn't like was the stylus pen.  It just didn't work as well as I expected it to.   I have to tap or swipe something 2 or 3 times before the device responds.   OTOH, I can use my finger and make a selection on the first try.  Perhaps the stylus will work better without the screen protector applied. Bottom line- I wanted to love this product, but for me it is \\\\\"just ok\\\\\".",

The FM transmitter works well and the clear station is great to have, all you have to do is put the phone in the dock and start playing your music, you only have to use the head phone cable to use the hands free option (as I often have people in the car with me I profer to use a blue tooth head set for calls anyway). The suction cup holds very well it is still stuck even after releasing the tention, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the arm that holds the dock is two short and the swivel doesn't swivel quite enough, in my car there isn't room for the head phone cable between the top of the phone and the windshield unless you turn it sideways, and it won't turn quite far enough to the side to really be perfectly adjusted for me. These are really minor issues how ever and may not be a problem at all in another car. If your looking for a dock for your car and don't have an aux Jack this is nearly perfect!<br /><br />This is an edit after having this for awhile the transmitter still works ok but the Hands free functions no longer work and the holder has gotten loose on the phone great idea pore quality I would still buy again for my uses unless something better comes along that does what this does.",

With that said as soon as I plug in the cord into the back of the stereo in the aux slot, the radio instantly switches over to aux. even if I don't have my ipod plugged in yet.

    "original_text": "First of all, reading through these reviews, I seriously think that several different versions are being reviewed here. There are people talking about CDs and firmware upgrades, mine did not come with a CD. Some people said that the software only helped if you had Win98, others referred to software that would convert video - I wish it had been included, because it was not easy to find. More on that below.<br /><br />If you are someone who has fairly picky standards for your gadgets, please, save your money and buy an iPod touch. I wish I had. But, my 11 year old thinks it's cool because it has the touch screen, and it does work, so it's not like i can send it back. For the price (around[...] at this writing), it's decent, but it tries to be too many things for that amount of money, and would have been better off if it had done fewer things, and done them better.<br /><br />For those of you, like me, trying to make the best of this gadget, here are some observations and tips:<br /><br />The screen: is not tremendously responsive. Also, the system is extremely laggy. Tap, and wait. Scrolling down the list of files is a bit tricky - tapping the arrows at the top or bottom will make it move down one screen, but might not let you get all the way to the bottom, and if you click once too many, it bounces back up. Carefully click-dragging the scrollbar works, but not well.<br /><br />Music player: no complaints. It's actually kind of nice to navigate by folder rather than by the various meta tags - though if you're used to having those lists by album/artist/genre, well, it could be a little annoying. I'm fine with the folders.<br /><br />FM Radio: why bother? Maybe it gets reception outside, but, I gave up after tuning into the closest/most powerful stations and  getting loads of static.<br /><br />Camera: well, in bright daylight, it is about as good as a mediocre camera phone from a few years ago. If you absolutely must take a picture, it will ... after a while. It really, really lags after you click camera. Video: again, quality similar to an old camera phone. Better than no camera, but not by much.<br /><br />Games: Game, actually. Tetris. Can't figure out if there's a way to 'hurry up' the bricks when they're moving slowly, and without that, I lack the patience to get through the first level at that painfully slow speed. Another why bother.<br /><br />Videos: If you didn't get a CD with some software to convert video, you can download it here:[...](you will want the Sonix7 Pro version). If the video you're converting is in the 16x9 aspect ratio, make sure to select that before encoding, and it will pad the video. [...] is a good resource also, it explains a lot of details about the ROCKCHIP (which this player uses).  Getting the video to actually play is a little tricky, especially if the movie is full-length.  i find it easier to select a tiny short video and then click the forward arrows to get to the larger video, otherwise it seems like it's never going to start.<br /><br />Oh, and the headphones are just terrible.<br /><br />So, with music and video both working at this point, I'm ready to say I'm relatively happy with this little gadget, though I only recommend it if you really, really want a cheap Chinese knockoff and are willing to put up with a very slow, laggy interface, and a *lot* of annoying quirks. It does have a nice screen for watching movies, and it does store a lot of media with the 8GB on board and optional micro SD.<br /><br />Still, I should have held out for an iPod. If nothing else I'd have about 8 hours of my life back, that I spent trying to figure out the video encoding before finally finding the software. Oh well, you live and you learn. At any rate, you live :)again, quality similar to an old camera phone. Better than no camera, but not by much.     Games: Game, actually. Tetris.

I've ordered an inline noise filter I'll be installing soon.  I'll report back on the success or failure of that.    ** The cable broke the second day.  It was in the car overnight, the temps got down to about 10 and when I got in the next morning and plugged my iPod in, the connector snapped completely off of one end.  The rubber/plastic had gone from fairly supple to almost completely rigid, and the miniscule wires inside were nowhere near big enough to withstand the strain with the jacket broken... this seems like a rather serious failing for an item meant to be used in vehicles that might be unheated for great lengths of time.",

While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\\\\"at least\\\\\" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RAX+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RAX+ radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RAX+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RAX+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RAX+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\\\\"AA\\\\\" or \\\\\"AAA\\\\\" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So\\\\\"if\\\\\" you want a \\\\\"pretty\\\\\" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\\\\"pretty\\\\\" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.\\\\\"if\\\\\" you want a \\\\\"pretty\\\\\" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

I used a can of truck bed liner from Rustolium and it it looks great. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it took 15 days to get here. I placed the order on the 19th of one month and finally received it the next month on the 4th. Granted there was a holiday it there, but it said 3-5 days standard shipping. That was a bit frustrating, and it's made in America so it didn't have to get shipped from China. I recommend this product highly, just don't expect to receive it right away.",

I just didn't expect this to happen because I have a screen protector on my cell phone and it's perfectly undetectable.  Of course that was a different product though.... Anyway... Im just feeling disappointed.  Another thing I didn't like was the stylus pen.  It just didn't work as well as I expected it to.   I have to tap or swipe something 2 or 3 times before the device responds.   OTOH, I can use my finger and make a selection on the first try.

Problem was - one of the chargers didn't work, but they were fairly quick to send a new charger. And when it is dead, it loses the date and time. Which brings me to the second problem - the date and time are really difficult to set. When you finally get the buttons pressed just right and you see the hour start to blink to set the time, don't hesitate because it only waits a little while then goes back to unset mode. As for the 2 way radio, it's not too bad, for the price. Reception is sometimes choppy and distorted, especially if my child goes around the other side of a brick house just across the street. Works best if there is a direct line of sight between them, but in that case you probably don't need a walkie-talkie.",

I'm using it at work and it does the job but one thing that's very odd is: The aux jack to plug in your ipod is on the back of the system.

With that said as soon as I plug in the cord into the back of the stereo in the aux slot, the radio instantly switches over to aux. even if I don't have my ipod plugged in yet. So now I have to plug and unplug the aux cord each time I want to use my ipod, which the plug is in the back, when it should be in the front.

Where the top and bottom plastic meet and the charging cable plug in feels very flemisy and the button to change the station can be real touchy.   Secondly once the iPod is charged I'm finding that the wireless FM can drain the battery in about 3 hours and without the adapter my iPod can run for about 10 hours before charge is low.     All and all worth the money it accomplishes all that I though it would. The seller is the best part very fast shipping I received the unit in 2 days.",
